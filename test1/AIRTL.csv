-0.02,"Pune: The 57-year-old boss of Tech Mahindra, C.P. Gurnani, says that Indian technology outsourcing companies have always transformed themselves in the past and that it will be wrong to write off the countrys $150-billion outsourcing industry even as new technologies disrupt the landscape. In an interview in Pune last week, Gurnani shared the bets Tech Mahindra is making and why he remains confident that the company will be able to remain relevant even as technology fundamentally changes the way companies across industries do business. Edited excerpts:
Analysts and commentators have started penning obituaries for the Indian IT outsourcing industry. From your perch, what is the future of Indian IT and Tech Mahindra? It will be wrong to write us off. I see the present as exciting times. Remember, Indian IT has seen changes all throughout its life. It all started with Father Kohli (F.C. Kohli, the first CEO of Tata Consultancy Services Ltd). The model then was that companies said, we have consultants and we will give them to you. Then the Y2K moment happened, which was like an inflection point.  In all these decades, the industry has grown. So, even now, the focus for Tech Mahindra, and I believe other Indian heritage IT firms, is that you need to make sure we remain relevant. Technology is changing industries around us. My priority No. 1 (is) to make ourselves remain relevant.ALSO READ | Tech Mahindra bets on DAVID strategy to fuel growthSo, how are you making Tech Mahindra stay relevant? Can you also share what are, say, the three big bets for Tech Mahindra? I can tell you not three but five. First is cybersecurity. Second is imaging as a service or say, a service where we use automation platform with radiologist, and run imaging as a service. No. 3 is blockchain. No. 4 is that we want to be the largest system integrator in the Internet of things (IoT). No. 5 is network services, as the world moves towards last-mile connectivity, and focus on software-defined networks (increases).All IT firms are talking about these newer tech. When can we see Tech Mahindra beginning to disclose the business it generates from each of these five big bets?We should be able to do this soon. The way we look at it is that we will take 12-16 months to incubate them. So, out of the five, three will go into production phase. It is possible that not all five will go into production phase. And so, I believe that the three which go into production, it is my duty to report the numbers. I have invested shareholder money and I guess it is the right of the shareholders to know what I have done with their money. So, we should be able to report the revenue or business once it goes into production (phase) after 12-16 months.How different will the Tech Mahindra of 2020 be? Currently, 65% of my business comes from IT while balance comes from engineering services, network services, customer experience, platform and security. Im taking a forward call and saying 50% will come from IT and 50% will come from different platforms by 2020. So, obviously there will be changes.Your thoughts on the internal goal of becoming a $10 billion firm by 2020, and what percentage of revenue will be called digital by then? Will it be more than half of your revenue, as against the 15-7% currently? Will it mean significant revenue from M&A?I cannot comment on the Internal  goals. But on your question of digital revenue, I would say that the way market is moving, getting more than 50% you see is not relevant. Because if I get the topline, I promise you, we will have more than 50% (coming from) digital.One of the things which is often held against Indian heritage IT firms is that they are too conservative. You are talking about blockchain. But if you are serious, then why not launch a service line? Take a more aggressive approach like the one adopted by IBM, which has set up business focused on blockchain technologies.I cannot comment on what approach other companies are taking. Im not betting my company on any one technology. If you look at my company, 65% of business which comes from traditional IT will change to 50% by 2020. So, I will still get 50% from IT. So, Im not betting my whole ranch on this. blockchain for all you know will be $200 million practice, say, for us when Im $8 billion or $9 billion. So, are you saying that there is enough in traditional business?I am not saying this. All I am saying is that my companys focus remains and will be in solving business problems. I will choose the technology. Im not getting married to one technology. And that is the difference between service and product companies. Tech Mahindra is perceived to be lagging behind in digital technologies. It does not have a strong consultancy arm, for instance. You are wrong when you say I dont have a strong consultancy arm. I have about 3,000 consultants. I have probably what is the largest IT telecom services firm out of India being a leader for the last 10 years and I will be the leader for the next 10 years. From the positioning point of view, I have taken a position:  I will be largest IT  firm in the media, communication and entertainment industry. We have launched DAVID, and the core reason to launch this is to make ourselves future-ready.",2016-12-21,05PcYpZOmBeSeBLoMPqETN,Tech Mahindra CEO CP Gurnani on bets his firm is making and why he remains confident that it will remain relevant in the face of disruptive technology,03:19,"By 2020, 50% of Tech Mahindras business will come from IT: CEO CP Gurnani "

				The RIL stock has risen 9.5% since 2 September to Rs1,109.35. During this time, the S&P BSE Sensex index has fallen 0.8%.Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltds long-awaited commercial launch has reduced the prolonged period of uncertainty that surrounded this venture. While it was clear that RIL was betting big on the telecom sector, there was no clarity on the launch date or  pricing strategy. Both questions have now been answered, and some analysts are excited about the companys prospects of gaining reasonable market share.To be sure, Jios success cant be taken for granted, especially as far as returns from the venture go. In a recent interview, RILs chairman Mukesh Ambani suggested that Jio was targeting a return of 18-19% on capital. That wont be easy to achieve. Analysts from Credit Suisse Securities (India) Pvt. Ltd indicate that achieving that would require revenues that are close to market leader Bharti Airtel Ltds; and a similar Arpu (average revenue per user) profile as the top three companies in the sector (around Rs210) at Bharti Airtels subscriber base (250 million). We believe such returns can be difficult to achieve in the first four years, they wrote  in a note to clients on 19 September.But Jio isnt the only reason for the renewed excitement around RIL shares. Benchmark Singapore complex gross refining margins (GRMs) have surged this month. GRM is a measure of profitability for refining firms. According to an analyst, Singapore GRM, the difference between the per barrel price of crude oil and the value of products distilled from it, touched $7 a barrel on Friday. In the June quarter, average GRM was at $5 a barrel. RILs refining business contributed as much as 68% of the companys stand-alone earnings before interest and tax in the June quarter. Additionally, RIL is also expected to benefit from higher light-heavy and lower Brent-Dubai spreads.Besides, analysts expect it to generate high free cash flow (FCF) from 2017-18. RIL is coming out of its capex phase, which in our view will pave the way for a multiyear cycle of strong FCF generation averaging $5 billion per annum over F1Y8-20, implying >11% FCF yield, wrote analysts from Morgan Stanley Research in a report on 25 September. RIL will benefit from the start of earnings delivery from downstream, which we expect to add ~$3.2 billion in Ebitda by FY18, assuming oil prices remain low at $50 a barrel. Ebitda, or earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization, is an indicator of operating profitability.But note that despite the recent outperformance, investors have lost out considerably from a long-term perspective.  The RIL stock has underperformed the Sensex in the last seven years by a huge margin. Currently, one share trades at 12.6 times estimated earnings for this fiscal year.

1.0,"Bengaluru: Abidali Neemuchwala completes a year on 1 February as Wipro Ltds chief executive officer (CEO). The former Tata Consultancy Services Ltd veteran, who joined Wipro as chief operating officer (COO) in April 2015, remains confident that by the end of March 2018, Wipro will be able to come back to industry-matching growth.
ALSO READ | Wipro revenue forecast underlines IT industrys challengesOver his 20 months at Wipro, Neemuchwala, who is based in Dallas, has focused on simplifying internal processes, worked on organization alignment to improve execution, embraced hyper automation and adopted an aggressive mergers and acquisitions approach. The measures have helped Wipro marginally improve upon the 3.7% dollar revenue growth recorded in 2015-16, which is  expected to grow at-best 5% in the year ending March. Edited excerpts from an interview:Three full quarters as CEO, and you have embarked on a journey by articulating six broad themes. Given these measures you have started, the management has said in the past that a complete turnaround will take time. Will it be fair to ask if the company can come back or say end March 2018 with industry-matching growth or Nasscom-projected growth numbers? How would you describe this quarter?Operationally, it was a good quarter. Our profitability improved in a quarter where there are furloughs and fewer working days. But I think in revenue growth we could have done more. But core business is doing well. India and Middle East business restructuring (had an impact) and Appirio (acquisition) closing also took time. So these things aside, Im very confident that Wipro is progressing well and I believe three-four quarters is a reasonable time frame (when we will come back to Industry-leading growth). You need all cylinders to be firing for industry-leading growth and that is what Im focusing on. One criticism of your 20-month stint, first as COO and then the 10 months as CEO, is that you have shied away from taking tough decisions when it comes to making or appointing leaders. Analysts believe you have continued with the same set of leaders. One of the things which is part of my nature is that we dont advertise tough decisions. As a CEO, you take tough decisions all the time. About 40% of my current leadership team, from direct reporting structure, is not what I inherited from T.K. Kurien. We have new leadership where ever it is required. (What) Im also very sensitive about is that whenever these changes happen, we do it very respectfully and consciously. So we dont make changes for the heck of making changes. In fact, I feel very good that if you as a journalist dont see this change, then customers also dont see this change. And this is the best thing for us. Remember, we have had a very smooth CEO transition, or rather the smoothest in the industry. Do you think there is a lot of noise on visa regulation in the US and Indian companies dependence on visas is actually coming down?Absolutely. The industry, including Wipro, has learnt to hire globally, many more local employees. Rebadged a lot of employees from our customers. Today I guide my hiring managers that dont make overseas job posting as an attraction. That era is over. So today I tell young talent that if you want to do great digital and path breaking and domain focused work, join Wipro. So dependence on visa has absolutely come down over the last few years. And so it is not that much of a worry because we believe that all business friendly decisions will be taken by the US government. What are say two challenges ahead of you, as you start calendar year 2017?Strategically, we have to future-proof our organization. So execution here will be key. Our exposure to telecoms and energy in the past had its impact. So balancing the whole portfolio takes time. We have to configure our business that we are diversified enough so that cyclical changes do not have more than impact.Now India and Middle East is creating new opportunities. Historically, we have had challenges. So we plan to complete in two quarters. So we hope to complete by Q1 of next financial year.

0.63,"Crossing the Rs8,000 crore- mark in stand-alone net profit for the first time is a milestone for Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL) indeed, but it would have been sweeter if other income had not played a crucial part in it. The December quarters (Q3) net profit was Rs8,022 crore, higher than what many analysts had expected. But other income rose by a third from a year ago to Rs3,025 crore, boosting profit growth to a good extent.
				   
				In fact, the refining business was expected to perform well thanks to a better refining operating environment, as the Singapore gross refining margin (GRM) had improved sequentially. Sure, the companys GRM improved to $10.8 a barrel from $10.1 a barrel in the September quarter but fell short of the expectations of many analysts. For instance, Kotak Institutional Equities and Nomura Research were expecting the measure at $11.3 a barrel and $11.5 a barrel, respectively. RILs premium over benchmark Singapore GRM at $4.1 per barrel is also the lowest in the past three quarters.Even as the petrochemicals business performed well with its Ebit (earnings before interest and tax) increasing 30% from a year earlier, the fact that RILs key business segment hasnt performed as expected is disappointing. Refining business Ebit accounted for almost two-thirds of the companys total Ebit in the quarter. The domestic oil and gas business posted a loss at the Ebit level, due to lower price realizations and lower volumes. The organized retail business has performed well but the segment is relatively small to have a meaningful overall impact.What of the stock? The RIL stock has underperformed the benchmark Sensex index so far this fiscal year. But its worth noting that the share price has appreciated about 16% from its closing low of Rs930 seen on 23 May 2016. Currently, one RIL share trades at 11 times estimated earnings for the next fiscal year. The refining environment continues to remain strong but is already known to investors and may not be enough to override their other concerns.RILs outstanding debt has increased to Rs1,94,381 crore as on 31 December from Rs1,89,132 crore as on 30 September. During the same time frame, cash and cash equivalents declined to Rs76,339 crore from Rs82,533 crore. That could be a concern, according to independent analyst S.P. Tulsian, who said, I believe this is mostly on account of increase in telecom capex, a business from which there is no clarity on revenue or Ebitda from a near-term perspective. The market is not going to react positively due to concerns on negative cash flows and unimpressive profit growth of refining, its core and main business segment, says Tulsian. Ebitda is earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization.Of course, all eyes will be on the performance of the telecom business. The company has recently expressed confidence saying that it will prove the financial communitys scepticism wrong with Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltds performance. The year 2017 will see a test of this optimism as Jio turns into a paid service, said CLSA in a report on 2 January.This year will also see stabilization of RILs downstream projects. Analyst expectations of incremental Ebitda from these projects remain markedly below guidance of $3bn-3.5bn, points out CLSA. The low expectations give room for surprise to the upside, added the report. The stock thus is likely to take cues from a combination of telecom and downstream projects news flow, which is where investor attention will also be focused in fiscal year 2018.",2017-01-17,343YGLUtdxSMgy0SZVbXEM,Reliance Industriess GRM improved to $10.8 a barrel from $10.1 a barrel in the September quarter but fell short of the expectations of many analysts,00:36,RILs refining business fails to wow in Q3
0.41,"Vodafone India Ltds June quarter results suggest competitive pressures eased in the voice segment for the mobile services industry; although the data segment continues to struggle for growth.The company said last week, Voice revenues returned to growth as competition eased, although the 2.2% year-on-year growth in June is nothing to get too excited about. Revenues were flat in the March quarter.Data revenue grew by 22%, year-on-year (y-o-y), down from 35% in the March quarter and as high as 65% just a year ago. Nevertheless, its heartening to note that the company has taken some steps to spur growth. On a quarter-on-quarter basis, data volume grew by 6.5%, up from a mere 0.7% growth in the March quarter.In the fourth quarter of the last fiscal, some companies such as Idea Cellular Ltd and Vodafone had reduced promotions in the market, which had resulted in slightly better price realizations, but had hit growth. There seems to have been a reversal in strategy in the June quarter. Its likely ldea, too, may report a bounceback in data growth sequentially.Of course, the key is for this growth to sustain. As things stand, the incumbents in the sector seem to be content upgrading existing users to 3G and 4G services. The total number of data users has more or less stagnated at Vodafone India. They have grown by only 4% in the past one year. The only reason data volume is growing at a faster pace is that a much larger proportion of users have shifted to 3G/4G services, where consumption is about three-to-four times higher, compared with 2G data services (see chart). Of course, theres a limit to how much the data segment can grow with this strategy.This month, Bharti Airtel Ltd, Idea and Vodafone increased data benefits in an attempt to get subscribers to increase usage. But such a strategy is unlikely to provide a breakthrough in attracting new data customers.As such, it seems like it will only be after Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltds launch that data prices will crash meaningfully enough to attract new users. Until then, the incumbents seem content to coast along as far as volumes and revenues go. Its important to note that despite sluggish volumes and a drop in price realizations, they have managed to maintain (in some cases, even improve) profit margins and generate large amounts of cash. Vodafone Indias profit margins stood at 28% two years ago, and are at over 29% now. Avoiding a mad rush for volume growth looks like a sane choice after all.",2016-07-25,3yLNXVt9kLeUIx2XURqvJJ,"It seems like it will only be after Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltds launch that data prices will crash meaningfully enough to attract new users

				Brookfield has been keen on acquiring renewable energy assets in India. They have recently started talks with Continuum to acquire the entire operational portfolio of the company, said one of the two people, requesting anonymity as the talks are private.Continuum has almost 400 megawatts (MW) of operational wind energy assets in Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh and Gujarat, he said. Investment bank Moelis and Co. is advising Continuum on the transaction, he added.According to the second of the two people, the transaction size could be in the range of Rs1,700-2,000 crore in terms of enterprise value. He also spoke on the condition of anonymity.Brookfield manages assets worth around $250 billion across various geographies and asset classes such as real estate, infrastructure, renewable energy and private equity.Continuum has been in talks for sometime to sell these assets. They had reached a deal with SunEdison, which later got scrapped because of SunEdisons financial troubles. Recently they were also in talks to raise primary capital with Partners Group, but those talks havent reached any conclusion and now they have engaged in discussions with Brookfield, the second person added.In June 2015, SunEdison had announced that it would acquire Continuums assets. In September, however, the deal was scrapped owing to SunEdisons financial problems. Morgan Stanley Infrastructure Partners is the majority owner in Continuum Wind, a Singapore-based, India-focused firm, in which it invested $212 million in 2012. Morgan Stanley Infrastructure Partners manages $4 billion globally.Continuum was set up in 2009 by Arvind Bansal and Vikash Saraf. Moelis and Partners Group declined to comment. Emails sent on Tuesday to Brookfield and Morgan Stanley did not elicit any response.Continuums asset sale talks with Brookfield come against the backdrop of a strong consolidation drive in Indias renewable energy industry.In June, Tata Power Co. Ltd acquired around 1.1 gigawatts of solar and wind power assets from Welspun Enterprise Ltd at an enterprise value of $1.4 billion.In September, Hyderabad-based renewable company Greenko Energy Holdings, acquired SunEdison Inc.s Indian solar asset portfolio for around $392 million. Also, in September, Mint had reported that Rahul Puris Hindustan Powerprojects Pvt.

				The Singapore complex gross refining margin (GRM), a measure of the difference between the per-barrel price of crude and the value of products distilled from it, dropped to $5 a barrel in the June quarter, compared with $7.7 a barrel in the March quarter. Still, the reported GRMs of Indian refining firms on a sequential basis fared better. However, these GRMs got a boost on account of inventory gains, thanks to the rising oil price trend over the quarter.Adjusted for refining inventory gains, the GRMs of oil marketing companies (OMCs) were in the range of $4-5 a barrel, according to Spark Capital Advisors (India) Pvt. Ltd. OMCs include Bharat Petroleum Corp. Ltd (BPCL), Hindustan Petroleum Corp. Ltd (HPCL) and Indian Oil Corp. Ltd (IOC). OMCs results beat Street expectations. IOCs operating profit increased by one-third, compared with last years June quarter. HPCLs operating profit rose 17% year-on-year, while BPCLs operating profit increased at a much slower pace of 3%.GRM is a measure of profitability.Reliance Industries Ltds (RIL) reported premium of $6.5 per barrel over Singapore GRM was the highest in the past eight years, according to the firm, and exceeded Street estimates by a good margin. Most analysts expected RILs GRM to be $9.5-10 per barrel. But RILs GRM came in at $11.5 per barrel. The management indicated $2 per barrel can be attributed to gains from inventory, hedging and risk management. RILs stand-alone revenue fell 19%, reflecting the decline in the broader crude oil prices, while net profit rose about 19%. That was because of a 628 basis points jump in operating profit margin, a 3% decline in depreciation cost and an 18.5% rise in other income. A basis point is 0.01%.Meanwhile, oil producers have had it tough what with oil prices languishing. As expected, net price realization of Oil and Natural Gas Corp. Ltd and Oil India Ltd declined 22% and 25% year-on-year, respectively.Oil marketing stocks have outperformed the Sensex so far this fiscal, while RIL stock has underperformed. However, RIL shares have performed well after the announcement of the imminent commercial launch of services by its telecom unit at its annual general meeting in early September. Singapore GRMs also strengthened in September, which helped sentiment.

0.42,"San Francisco:  Elon Musk showcased his ambitions to make Tesla Motors Inc. a clean-energy behemoth on Friday, unveiling a new solar-roof product at an evening event at Universal Studios in Los Angeles, California.
				   
				As the sun set, Musk told hundreds of guests gathered outside that Tesla and SolarCity Corp., the company that he chairs and which he aims to acquire, will make solar roofs that look better than normal roofs. He then showcased several houses with different roofing styles and said they were all solar, with solar panels embedded into glass shingles.How do we have a solar roof that is better than a normal roof, looks better, last longer, said Musk. You want to pull your neighbours over and say Check out this sweet roof.Musks presentation was short on details about the efficiency of the solar roofs, their warranty, cost or when they will be available. The solar roof is offered in four styles: Textured Glass Tile, Slate Glass Tile, Tuscan Glass Tile, and Smooth Glass Tile  due to a variety of architectural styles.Home batteriesThe idea is that homeowners will generate electricity for their home with solar power, then store that electricity in a home battery known as a Powerwall. You can fill up your battery during the day, then discharge it at night when the sun sets.Musk and Tesla chief technology officer JB Straubel have long envisioned a clean-energy future of electric cars powered by an increasingly solar grid, with Teslas batteries optimizing both. The company also offers much larger Powerpack systems to commercial and utility customers and has deployed almost 300 megawatt hours in 18 countries to date, according to a blog post on Thursday.Battery-based energy storage has the potential to revolutionize electricity for the worlds poorest citizens the way mobile technology disrupted the telecommunications industry. Coupled with solar panels or wind turbines, powerful lithium-ion batteries can store energy and provide electricity for the roughly 1.3 billion people worldwide who dont have access to electricity and face whats called energy poverty.Fridays event is part of concerted effort to make the case for the SolarCity acquisition to investors. More details, including financial information, will be revealed 1 November, when the company has said it plans to create a clear picture of how a combined Tesla and SolarCity will make solar and storage as compelling as electric vehicles. The proposed merger has been controversial because Musk is the chairman and largest financier of SolarCity, and the boards of both companies are deeply intertwined.

-0.55,"Singapore: This weeks putsch at Tata Sons has already served one useful purpose. While its been clear for a while that something wasnt quite right at the $100 billion Indian empire, the chairmans surprise ouster has made it possible to start asking questions about strategy (or lack of it) at a conglomerate that traces its roots to the American civil war.
				   
				Did the newly dumped Cyrus Mistry fail to plant enough saplings of growth? Or did Ratan Tata, who gave Mistry the job only to take it back four years later, not want to face reality? Are some of the businesses he acquired now covered in weeds, compelling Mistry to trim the outgrowth of debt?The answers will be important for investors in the groups publicly traded units, who, at present, have no idea how the coup at the holding company will affect them.Letting Tata vs. Mistry play out in public is a delicious idea. With the Economic Times leaking the contents of an unhappy email purportedly written by Mistry to the Tata Sons board and owners, and at least one of those shareholders giving a TV interview on what they disliked about the Mistry regime, the slugfest has begun. Its time to pour a cup of (Tata-owned) Tetley tea, and settle down.Also Read: Tata Sons dividend payout steady for last decadeV.R. Mehta, a trustee at one of the philanthropic organizations that collectively own roughly two-thirds of Tata Sons, is right to argue that under Mistry, the dividends from group companies have become increasingly reliant on just two businesses  Jaguar Land Rover, one of Ratan Tatas most audacious acquisitions, and Tata Consultancy Services Ltd., the software export unit.But to what extent is Mistry responsible? In the letter attributed to him by the Economic Times, the ousted chairman claimed that it was Ratan Tatas 2009 decision to buy a property in suburban Mumbai  in disuse since a 1993 bomb attack  that led to Indian Hotels Co.s entire net worth getting wiped out. The companys last big profit, of $115 million, was in 2008.Then again, a year after Ratan Tata bought Corus Group Plc in 2006, Tata Steel went on to earn an annual profit of almost $3 billion. A China-led global steel glut has turned that profit into a loss of $1 billion over the past four quarters, with Mistry warning in his letter of a potential $10 billion impairment of European steel assets.Tata Steels loss in past 4 quartersMistry cant shift all the blame to his predecessor. While Ratan Tatas non-JLR car investments have mostly flopped, Mistrys problem was not having enough big ideas of his own. He may not have been the one to sink the wireless telecom unit, but he did precious little to revive it. He could also have handled the ugly spat with NTT Docomo Inc., the partner in that business, a lot better.Also Read: Ratan Tata seeks to rally group firms after Cyrus Mistry ousterThe Tata Group has survived two world wars, nationalization of its prized airline by a socialist-minded government and other tribulations. But the damage to the groups reputation for fair dealing is probably Mistrys biggest failing as chairman.That failure has consequences. In Singapore, bond investors are scratching their heads over a dollar-denominated perpetual bond issue by Tata International Ltd. The debt of this thinly capitalized company will derive its value from implicit support by the Tata group. A few years ago, it would have been preposterous to suggest that the Tatas would stake their reputation to save $1.17 billion  the amount the group is seeking to avoid paying in the Docomo dispute. Its worrisome if investors are no longer sure whether the group will even back a $150 million to $200 million bond issue. A no-holds-barred airing of differences between Mistry and Ratan Tata may help reestablish just what it is that shareholders of Tata Sons want their group to stand for. That will be the cherry on the cake from this entertaining spectacle  to be washed down with that Tetley tea, of course.

0.5,"The December quarter was expected to be a tough one for Zee Entertainment Enterprises Ltd, as advertisers cut spending in response to demonetisation. 
				   
				That was expected to show in the companys performance in the quarter, which it did, but the big surprise was on the profitability front. Its Ebitda of Rs515.8 crore was much higher than the Streets estimates. For instance, Kotak Institutional Equities and Edelweiss Securities Ltd were expecting the Ebitda at Rs430 crore. Ebitda is earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization.ALSO READ | Zee Entertainments profit up 8.6% at Rs250.8 croreA decline in costs led to this improvement, as overall revenue growth was just 3.4% compared to a year ago. Other expenses,  and advertising and publicity expenses declined.Coming to the advertising performance, Zee Entertainments consolidated ad revenue, accounting for 58% of total revenue, rose 3.4% year-on-year for the December quarter. In comparison, it had increased 15.7% and 19%, respectively, in the September and June quarters.According to the company, advertising revenue growth during the first 40 days of the quarter, i.e. pre-demonetisation, was similar to the growth seen in the half year ended September. What offers some comfort is that Zee Entertainments December quarter ad revenue performance was better than some analysts expectations. For instance, Kotak and Edelweiss were expecting ad revenue growth of 2% and 1%, respectively.Subscription revenue, accounting for 36% of total revenue, increased 13.7%, helped by closure of content deals with a few large distribution platform operators during the quarter. Subscription revenue included some catch-up revenues for the previous quarters. After a good quarter, much depends on how advertising shapes up. According to Mihir Modi, chief finance and strategy officer at Zee Entertainment, while advertising growth is better than November and December, it hasnt gone back to pre-demonetisation days.For the next six-eight months, Modi expects telecom and auto sectors to give impetus to advertising growth. The push from the telecom sector will be driven by Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd while automobile launches will boost auto sector growth.Zee Entertainments shares have outperformed the benchmark Sensex so far this fiscal year. But more recently, the stock has been hit by the demonetisation blow. From a closing high of Rs579 in early October, the stock has declined 14% till now. Currently, one share trades at 30 times estimated earnings for the next fiscal year. The question investors will be grappling with is if the March quarter will see advertising revenue return to pre-demonetisation levels. That will determine the fortunes of the stock in the near future.",2017-01-26,5ZCxgMD00DaD9Ped8133pI,"A decline in costs led to the profitability surprise, as overall revenue growth was just 3.4% compared to a year ago",07:25,Zee springs profitability surprise even though revenue hit by note ban

				Rami Rahim, an M.Sc. in electrical engineering from Stanford University and a Juniper veteran, has risen through the ranks to his current role of chief executive officer. In an interview, he talks about the changing digital landscape, the evolution of software-defined networking and the impact of cloud computing. Excerpts: Why did you feel the need to come up with another term, digital cohesion, when digital transformation already exists?The idea behind digital cohesion is to paint a vision of the future that people can relate to. When you talk about some of the advances in technology, in networking for example, while our partners, customers and stakeholders understand it inherently, but for a broader set of population, it is a bit difficult to relate to because they are not in this business. So digital cohesion paints an exciting vision of the future around technology and applications playing an interesting and important part in our day-to-day lives, of how these will come together to create truly life-enhancing experiences. And then to distil it down to a set of technology barriers that must be overcome in order for that vision to become a reality. Doing this makes the motivation to overcome those barriers really compelling.What will digital cohesion do that digital transformation wont?Digital transformation is typically around changes in business and technology, how these two come together to create new business opportunities through more agility and business efficiency. Digital cohesion is different: its coming together of applications and services to solve really interesting problems in the consumer and the business space. But both are important concepts.You have envisioned a world in which self-assembling apps will provide predictive, personalized services to people. Dont you think this will further increase the risk to personal privacy and data security? Right, this is one of the big barriers to this future in which the applications are always on in the background, as the mega cloud providers and service providers will need to collect a lot of information to be able to act on it. That can only happen when a lot of thought has been put into privacy policies and cyber security. As more and more applications are going to be connected, each of those connections presents an opening for the bad actors to come in and compromise the network and thus user data. We believe it will require a fundamentally different architectural approach to do what is necessary to improve the overall security posture of the network. What is the update on software-defined networking (SDN)?Any new technology or architecture goes through a hype cycle and SDN has gone through that cycle. About a year or so back, SDN was touted as the answer to most networking problems but that clearly is not the case. One should understand that software has always played a very important role in networking. In the past, our software and hardware systems were very tightly integrated but now they are loosely coupled and we are already offering software separately. Also, networking-as-a-service will add more value to the domain.At one point, Juniper was broad-basing its customer segment from telecom operators to other enterprises. But now with cloud coming up in a big way, most enterprises may not be buying networking gear at all. How is Juniper coping with this situation?The cloud is the single biggest trend that is impacting our industry and therefore our strategy today as a company. There are many types of companies in the cloud market, including the mega cloud companies, software-as-a-service and platform-as-a-service players, co-location hosting providers and many others. This segment has been a very important part of our business and, over the past several years, revenue from these companies has double as a percentage of our total revenue. We are also helping telecom operators transform and grow their cloud, in addition to helping enterprises with a hybrid architecture in connecting their own data centres to the cloud. The approaching Internet of Things (IoT) world and your vision of digital cohesion will put a lot of strain on networks. What role will Juniper play here?I think IoT and 5G (fifth generation mobile technology) are both going to be cloud-native technologies. This means the services to the end consumers will be developed in a virtualized manner and delivered from a data centre. That is what we believe we are most suited forto provide the cloud infrastructure and solutions for data centres, wide area networks and the software that helps our customers in tapping into the cloud data centres with ease and agility.",2016-12-22,5a2p4CTEMC5oR85Il3Jx4J,"The cloud is the single biggest trend that is impacting our industry and therefore our strategy today as a company, says Juniper CEO Rami Rahim",00:58,Cloud is the biggest trend impacting networking industry: Juniper CEO
1.0,"Bengaluru: A little over two decades back, K.R.Sridhar worked on a NASA mission to convert Martian atmospheric gases to oxygen for propulsion and life support. His work was so ahead of its time that Fortune magazine called him one of the top five futurists inventing tomorrow, today.
				   
				Fast forward to 2016, and the Indian-born rocket scientist-turned-entrepreneur is on a completely different mission: to provide clean, reliable energy for all on Earth.Sridhar, who founded Silicon Valley-based Bloom Energy that makes electricity from (solid oxide) fuel cells using natural gas, has finally brought the technology to India.In an interview with Mint, he talked about how it all started, the efficiency of green technology, why India needs it now more than ever and how it will navigate a few challenges unique to Asias third-largest economy. Edited excerpts:How did Bloom Energy come about?I started out trying to figure out how to create oxygen on Mars, and then along the way, to create water, breathing air, electricity and all those things so that you can think of a sustainable habitat. So I was working on that, but clearly American interest in space exploration started waning after the Cold War because we had other interests and other places to spend our money on. So I realized that seeing a human mission to Mars is not going to happen within the time frame, maybe not in my lifetime. So I started thinking of what I could do that could be impactful. I realized that water and energy are the biggest issues we are going to face in the next 100 years, given that we will get to 10 billion people on the planet. I also knew that if I had cleaner electricity, I could always provide clean water.What do you want to accomplish in India?India is a perfect place for us to prove our basic value proposition: which is you need to decentralize before you distribute it. India has proven that more than any other countryboth in computing and in telecom. If you think about supply of electricity and given when it is available, the extremely bad quality of that supply and the extreme environmental impact of that supply, we can take a page from computing and apply it to power and create distributed, sustainable power all over the country. It can become the model for the rest of the world to follow.Is it hard to sell your technology in a country like India?It is harder and easier. Its harder because until now the gas infrastructure did not exist and there wasnt a company like GAIL telling people, you buy this and we will provide the infrastructure for you and we will provide a reliable supply of gas for you. So it was hard. It is easier because in a place like the US, while they are hurling towards technology and are not afraid of new technology, the grid was fairly adequate and there was enough access to power and there wasnt a demand-supply mismatch. Whereas here, you are offering people power against not having power. So, its easier from that perspective. So it is both.There are many who think that a decentralised (generation and distribution) model will not work for gas-based technologies in India, but only in markets similar to the US. What are your thoughts?Natural gas will be the most abundantly available fuel in the 21st century for electric power generation around the world. This abundance will result in increasingly improved economics and an expanded global export market. Add the fact that natural gas is the lowest carbon fossil fuel and you have a very attractive fuel for power generation. This is the significance of our partnership with GAIL which is committed to expanding the natural gas infrastructure for decentralized power generation in India. With this, we believe that decentralised gas-fuelled power generation has a bright future in India and will help this country make the same kind of technology leapfrog in power generation from centralized to distributed that we have seen in telephonythe country avoided the fixed infrastructure investments of landline telephones and went straight to mobile.Your tariffs are still considerably above other alternate sources of power.The important question is what you are providing. Do they find the value in what you are doing. You may have a (cheaper) solar power plan, but with a solar panel on your roof, if you cannot turn on the lights in the night, when the sun is not shining, that power is not of much use to you. It doesnt matter what it costs.You may get a (cheaper) coal power plan because of which your child can study because the lights are on, but if that childs life is going to be reduced by 10 years because of all the pollution it puts up, you are going to wonder if that is the best alternative.A household may think, cheap power is good enough, why do I need more. The average life of all their appliances in their house is going down so fast because of problems with voltage and stability. They are never able to calculate the cost associated with that. They sometimes dont realize that they are paying significantly more for a refrigerator because the company had to build all these additional band-aids for that power, to make sure the warranty problem doesnt come to them and charge them more. It is about total overall value, as opposed to the essential value of commodities. That is an education that we have to do.We absolutely know that we have a learning curve and a cost curve. We are confident that over a few years with scale, people will use us not just because of all the positive attributes we bring, but also be cause we are the most affordable.How do you plan to procure biogas? Though GAIL has promised you natural gas, you will need more supply. So think of this1.3, fast forward 1.4 billion people in the nationthe amount of human waste, the amount of animal waste that comes from supporting this, the amount of plant waste that comes from supporting the animals and the plants is gigantic and it is either a liability or can be converted into an asset. And to us, it should be an asset and that becomes the biogas fuel. In the past, it was always a problem because the power plants were very, very large and you needed to go long distances to collect the biomass, bringing it to a huge centralized base and the cost of carrying it over a long distance was incredible.But, in the distributed Bloom model, people can take their own bio-waste and put that into their own bio-mass plant, generate their own biogas and produce their own power. And, in a true Gandhian way, can have a completely sustained solution.Are you happy with GAILs infrastructure in Bengaluru (where Bloom is powering technology company Intels R&D lab)?I dont think GAIL will say they are happy with it because they are aggressively trying to get into Bangalore, and as you know, in any big city like Bangalore, there are issues of being able to lay a pipeline quickly and all that. However, what I am extremely impressed with is the aggressive speed and passion with which they want to get it done, in spite of obstacles.What incentives are you offering to get more companies to sign up?You do that when you dont believe in your product. Our product more than speaks for itself. We are satisfying an unmet need. Those corporate customers have a root canal. I am offering them a pain killer. I dont need to discount it.But, if you look at the US, places where it worked were states where there were incentives or subsidies. Isnt it?True, there are different ways to look at it. If it were a level-playing field, we would require more subsidies. Because everyone else is subsidized. Not giving a subsidy to us puts us on an uneven playing field. That is the reason we need subsidies in the US.Could you eventually think of powering individual homes too?It may not be the best thing because if you think of individual homes, the evenings and mornings, when you do all these things, that (is when) you may be consuming power. It may be capital inefficient for you to have a piece of equipment that is not working for you all the time. It will better for a cluster of homes and businesses to be in a little micro-grid. I think thats a better solution than having a little box in every home.Where exactly will your fuel cell packs be installed?It should be right where you use it and where its under your control. Typically, you never did that because these power generators were noisy, they vibrated and so you liked to put it far awayout of sight, out of mind. Here is a beautiful looking piece of equipment, children can play around it, people can have a picnic table around it. You can put it on a rooftop, on a basement or next to a parking lot. For the same amount of energy that you can produce, we require 120 times less land. So, (while) land use is a big issue usually (with respect to  power generation), this is a non-issue for us.When are you going public?Going public is just a step of a long process for a company. It is not even the beginning to the end, its just one small step. When we are ready, we will do it. We are definitely closer to it than we were.People can think what they want. It is a private company and our stakeholdersour investors, customers and employeesare all happy with the path we have taken.Are you profitable?We can state with no uncertainty that if we dont find a path to make our own company sustainable, we cannot make the planet sustainable. We have a path for sustainability, both for us and our planet. Being a private company we dont discuss these things.Can you tell me about your energy capacity? Where do you see it in five years?We are very actively engaged in building a pipeline for customers. We have actively started engaging with prospective customers. Obviously in the regions where natural gas is available like Delhi, Mumbai, Bangalore and Hyderabad. Places like that where there is both an availability of natural gas and a supply-demand mismatch, where electricity is a problem. Hopefully, next year, when you see me, the numbers will be impressive.Could you possibly look at local manufacturing of fuel cells to bring costs down?We already manufacture some component systems in India and make use of supply chain partners which also contribute Make in India manufactured goods which are incorporated into our systems. As the market develops in India and volume justifies it, we expect more Make in India content in our systems.Will Bloom Energy seek to source biogas from local plants for generation of electricity if enough natural gas is not available?This is among the options we are considering, especially in more rural areas.How do you plan to raise funds?As a private company, we dont discuss our funding requirements. We are a very healthy company, well-positioned to execute our business plan.Costs associated with building and maintaining fuel cells are pretty high. How can you change that?We are already economically attractive for certain types of customersthose commercial or government entities that have significant business critical operations that cannot suffer interruption of power. Like any new, transformative technology, Blooms technology is riding a steep cost-down path as innovation and market volume forces come together to bring down cost. We are extremely confident that this trend will continue for many years.How do you rate India companies when it comes to sustainability initiatives?We applaud that sustainability is an increasing focus for India Inc. Much is left to be done and the challenge is significant to improving the sustainability of business operations in India and for the society.What are the three biggest problems with Indias power infrastructure?We see the three biggest challenges as lack of access and adequate supply of electric power to fully support the society, challenges with power reliability and power outages, and still high CO2, high nox (oxides of Nitrogen), sox (oxides of sulphur) and particulate emissions relative to what is possible today with an advanced technology such as Bloom.Whats your advice to young entrepreneurs?Pick something you are passionate (about), because there are so many ups and downs. To be able to still go ahead, that passion needs to be strong. It should be yours and not someone elses.(Theres) nothing wrong in being a capitalist, nothing wrong in wanting to make money. But money is a lot more satisfying, if you also find something that has a social impact.Gireesh Chandra Prasad in New Delhi contributed to this story",2016-10-17,6p08znifFPuASBf1TXMe6I,"KR Sridhar talks about the efficiency of green technology, why India needs it and how Bloom Energy will navigate through challenges unique to the country",01:17,Decentralized gas-fuelled power generation has a bright future: Bloom Energy CEO

				The company reported Ebitda (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) of Rs1,496 crore during the period. The sharing revenue per tower per month increased by 4.1%.The company also claimed co-location additions, at 6,139, in the quarter were the highest in the past five years and reported a total tower base of 90,255.Indian telecom is witnessing strong data growth, led by the digitization wave across the country.

0.47,"Reliance Communications Ltd (RCom) reported another set of sub-par results, with revenues and operating profit for the quarter ended 30 September declining by more than 4% sequentially in its India operations. The company doesnt report results for its wireless business separately anymore, and the India business is therefore the best proxy for it. 
				   
				Earlier, Bharti Airtel Ltd and Idea Cellular Ltd had reported sequential revenue declines of around 2%, largely due to the seasonality factor. RCom said in a press statement that results for the quarter were impacted by an increase in competitive intensity, migration of CDMA customers to 4G LTE and seasonality factors. Its understandable that the migration attempt will result in some disruption. Average revenue per user rose 5% sequentially, suggesting a larger proportion of low-value customers have been lost. But overall, given the continued sluggishness, theres hardly anything for investors to get excited about. RCom shares have more than halved in the current year, and initial enthusiasm about the companys strategic deals with Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd as well as its deleveraging plans has waned.All of the debt-reduction plans the company has talked about are still a work-in-progress and some of them are at fairly preliminary stages. And while the merger of its wireless business with Aircel Ltd may come through, the success of the deal depends largely on how successful the two are in raising a large amount of equity capital in the combined entity. And the current environment, where telecom stocks have fallen at a fast pace, is hardly conducive for raising equity. There is also lack of clarity about RComs arrangements with Reliance Jio for use of the latters 4G network, and how beneficial the deal will be. A look at how the companys shares have moved this year suggests investors are not very hopeful about RComs prospects.Reliance Group companies have sued HT Media Ltd, Mints publisher, and nine others in the Bombay high court over a 2 October 2014 front-page story that they have disputed.

0.26,"The Cabinet has approved the spectrum auction plan recommended by the department of telecommunication. The value of the spectrum that is being put up for the auction is more than Rs.5 trillion, based on the proposed reserve price. Hardly anyone expects telecom companies to bid for the entire spectrum; although based on past experience, with Indian telecom firms, you can never say never.
				   
				About three-fourths of the total spectrum on offer, in value terms, is in the 700 megahertz (MHz) band. Telecom firms such as Bharti Airtel Ltd have said that the pricing makes it unaffordable. Also, if the government has managed to make contiguous blocks of 1800MHz spectrum available in the auction, the demand for spectrum in the 700MHz band will naturally be low.Most importantly, the sectors debt is already at monumental levels and based on leverage metrics such as debt/Ebitda, there is hardly any leeway in terms of taking on much additional debt. As such, the Rs.4 trillion worth 700MHz spectrum should ideally be left untouched.Even so, some telecom firms may still explore bidding in a few circlessuch as B and C circles where pricing of this spectrum is not as expensive vis-à-vis other bands. If bidding is restricted to these circles, investors will be largely unconcerned. But if extends to other circles, and telecom firms get bold as they have in some previous auctions, investors have much to worry.As pointed earlier in this column, the governments approach leaves much to be desired. It seems to be least bothered about the financial health of the industry, and is treating it as a golden goose.Of course, the government cant be entirely blamed when telcos themselves have been reckless while bidding in past auctions. According to analysts, this is one of the reasons telecom stocks have underperformed in recent months. The upcoming mega auction is making some investors nervous. Analysts at Kotak Institutional Equities said in a note to clients earlier this year, Even as Bharti India CEO, in the 3QFY16 earnings concall, repeatedly termed the Trais (Telecom Regulatory Authority of Indias) proposed 700MHz spectrum reserve prices unaffordable, we hope we do not end up with a treatise titled Art of buying the unaffordable, volume 3 sometime post the proposed auctions.",2016-06-22,8KBlcj1fZmd8pP2JFG8HcI,"The sectors debt is at monumental levels, but the government seems to be least bothered about its financial health and is treating it as a golden goose

0.9,"Ousted Tata Sons chairman Cyrus Mistry was pushing C. Sivasankaran, who had played dealmaker in several Tata group transactions in the past, to pay up the Siva groups share of the DoCoMo award, and also discussed with the board of the holding company possible legal action against the sometimes controversial, Seychelles-based entrepreneur, documents seen by Mint show.
				   
				On 15 September, at his penultimate Tata Sons board meeting as chairman, Mistry raised this issue, the documents show. He was removed as chairman when the board next met on 24 October.Interestingly, on 19 September, Tata Sons (Tata Teleservices Ltd and NTT DoCoMo Inc. are named as co-respondents) received a legal notice from a firm retained by Sivasankarans Sterling Info-tech Ltd, alleging mismanagement of Tata Teleservices and reserving the right to seek damages to recover its (Sterlings) losses.Mint learns that a decision on how to respond to this email had not been taken till Mistrys exit.Tata group spokesperson Debasis Ray said in an email response to Mints queries that in 2008, when Docomo agreed to acquire shares of Tata Teleservices, Tata Sons voluntarily offered other shareholders of TTSL an opportunity for a pro-rata sale of their holdings. This was subject to the shareholders agreeing to bear a pro-rata portion of any claims or amounts payable to Docomo should such an event arise.... Thereafter in 2014, Docomo exercised the put option. In terms of the agreement with the selling shareholders, Tata Sons demanded from Mr Sivasankaran his pro-rata share of the amount payable to Docomo.Ray added that Tata Sons is pursuing all legal options for recovery of this amount.Mint couldnt ascertain whether the company had responded to Sivasankarans notice. Sivasankaran could not be reached for comment immediately.The notice from Sivasankarans law firm mentions his long-standing association with the Tata Group of Companies on account of his close association with Mr Ratan Tata.Sivasankaran has had several dealings with the group, taking Barista, Indias first coffee chain that the Tata group had acquired, off its hands, selling Dishnet DSL to the Tata-owned VSNL, which subsequently became Tata Communications, and facilitating the sale of the Tata stake in the Birla-Tata-AT&T telecom venture to the Aditya Birla Group, resulting in the formation of Idea Cellular Ltd.In early 2006, the Siva group acquired 520 million shares in Tata Teleservices at Rs 17 per share or Rs884 crore. It paid Rs102 crore towards this, the documents show. It paid the balance in February 2006. Of the Rs782 crore, the documents show that Rs650 crore was funded by a loan from Standard Chartered Bank effectively guaranteed by Tata Sons. The balance Rs132 crore came from Kalimati Investments, a subsidiary of Tata Steel.Ray confirmed both and said that to ensure that in the event of a default on the repayment of the loan, the shares of Tata Teleservices were not sold to a third party, Tata Sons agreed to an arrangement whereby the bank would sell the shares to Tata Sons.He added that a part of the consideration was funded by another Tata company for a few days on market-linked terms.In 2006, when the loan was refunded, the Tata group withdrew this guarantee, and the Siva group had to provided other collateral to the bank, the documents show.Then came the 2008 deal with DoCoMo under which the latter bought shares amounting to 26% of Tata Teleservices equity. Of the 26%, 20% was to be fresh equity and 6%, a sale by existing shareholders. Under this, the documents with Mint show, Sivasankaran sold 20.74 million shares at Rs117.81 apiece, turning a tidy profit.The DoCoMo investment eventually turned sour, and with no initial public offering in sight, the Japanese company exercised a put option. The resulting litigation led to an award of Rs8,450 crore to DoCoMo. Of this, the Siva groups share was Rs694 crore.The September legal notice from the Siva group and a letter to Mistry in October 2013 from Sivasankaran refer to Tata Teleservicess dire need for equity, and present the Siva groups investment in the company as a sort of lifeline.This representation was disputed by Mistry in his response to the letter. I have been advised by Mr (Ratan) Tata that the investment made by the Siva Group was made principally on the consideration that the telecom sector was fast-growing and represented a good investment opportunity. In his letter, Sivasankaran referred to an earlier letter to Ratan Tata in 2011 seeking assistance in finding a buyer for the Siva groups holding in Tata Teleservices.He further asks Mistry for a fair resolution (presumably a buyback of his holdings) in line with the mutually benevolent relation between the Tata group and Siva group which made the Siva group walk the extra miles to support the Tata group by undertaking risks which no financial investor acting in self-interest would.From Rays comments, it looks like that resolution is headed for the courts.",2016-11-09,8UuRA0q7zaqX07hXw3QxPL,"At his penultimate Tata Sons board meeting as chairman, Cyrus Mistry raised the issue, the documents show",01:31,Cyrus Mistry was trying to get Siva group to pay share of DoCoMo award

Instead, the 59-year-old edged aside his heir apparent, cut the biggest deal of his career yet and revealed on Friday his ambition to become one of the worlds most powerful investors.SoftBank said it is forming a new fund to put as much as $100 billion in the global technology industry in the next five years, partnering with Saudi Arabias public investment fund to find companies that will become influential in the future. By comparison, all the venture capital funds in the world disbursed a record $129.5 billion in funding in 2015, according to CB Insights.The man who once proclaimed his goal of creating the worlds most valuable company isnt hiding his ambition: Over the next decade, he aims to be the biggest investor in technology.In other words, Japans second-richest man isnt going anywhere. Son in 2014 brought in Nikesh Arora, luring the former Google executive with a pay package that rivaled those of Apple Inc.s Tim Cook and Walt Disney Co.s Bob Iger. He spent two years grooming him as a successor only to change his mind in June. A month later SoftBank announced plans for a $32 billion takeover of chip designer ARM Holdings Plc, Sons biggest bet to date and a wager on the future of interconnected devices.For some time, it seemed like Son has fatigued, considering retirement and bringing in Arora. It is pretty clear now that he is still full of zeal, said Makoto Kikuchi, chief executive officer of Myojo Asset Management Co.It is not yet clear who will call the shots at what is tentatively named SoftBank Vision Fund and the Japanese company declined to comment further, noting the fund had not yet closed. SoftBank named Rajeev Misra, its head of strategic finance, to lead the project.Son has made tens of billions in returns from investments in companies including Alibaba Group Holding Ltd, Yahoo and Supercell Oy, and the new fund will likely pursue a similar strategy of backing technology companies at all stages. While Arora was SoftBanks president, the company had plans to put about $3 billion into startups each year.During his two year tenure, Arora spearheaded investments in Indian e-commerce provider Snapdeal.com, ride-hailing service Ola Cabs, real-estate website Housing.com and hotel-booking app Oyo Rooms. In October 2015, SoftBank led a $1 billion fund-raising round for US-based online lender Social Finance Inc.Over the next decade, the SoftBank Vision Fund will be the biggest investor in the technology sector, Son, chairman and chief executive officer of SoftBank, said in a statement Friday. We will further accelerate the information revolution by contributing to its development.The Saudi government will consider putting money into the fund and become the lead investment partner, SoftBank said in the statement. The Tokyo-based company, which will invest as much as $25 billion, signed a non-binding memorandum of understanding with the Saudis, who may put in as much as $45 billion over the next five years. Other large global investors may participate to increase the pool to $100 billion.Also Read: SoftBank tech fund to invest up to $100 billion with Saudi ArabiaSoftBank said that the fund will be reflected on its consolidated financial statements, without giving further details. Its shares rose as much as 3.7% in Tokyo. The stock had gained 5.8% this year before today, compared with a 12% decline in the benchmark Nikkei 225 index.The company is stepping up investment activity even though it has more than $100 billion in debt. SoftBank has relied on borrowing and earnings from its domestic telecom operations to pay for investments in start-ups in India, US and China while balancing losses at its US subsidiary Sprint Corp. By tapping outside investors, Son will be able to cut more ambitious deals than he could on his own.Also Read: SoftBanks robot Pepper gets to work at Taiwan bankARM acquisition has brought Son to a limit of how much he can invest just with SoftBanks balance sheet, Myojos Kikuchi said.The companys high-speed Internet and wireless services in Japan generated 1.16 trillion yen ($11.2 billion) of earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization in the fiscal year ended 31 March. SoftBank has 3.5 trillion yen of bonds maturing in the next five years, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.Its conceivable that after capturing the core of the Internet of Things with ARM, Son will next look to other semiconductors, electronic components and software, said Hideki Yasuda, an analyst at Ace Research Institute in Tokyo. SoftBank has a proven track record of investment successes.

0.49,"Brussels: Online messaging and email services such as WhatsApp, iMessage and Gmail will face tough new rules on how they can track users under a proposal presented by the European Union executive on Tuesday.
				   
				The web players will have to guarantee the confidentiality of their customers conversations and ask for their consent before tracking them online to serve them personalised ads.The proposal by the European Commission extends some rules that now only apply to telecom operators to web companies offering calls and messages using the internet, known as Over-The-Top (OTT) services, seeking to close a perceived regulatory gap between the telecoms industry and mainly US Internet giants such as Facebook, Google and Microsoft.Tuesdays proposal would allow telecom companies to use customer metadata  such as the duration and location of calls  to provide additional services and make more money, something they are barred from doing under the current rules.However the telecoms industry said the proposal still imposed stricter obligations on them than on web companies.Unlike others, telcos risk being prevented from expanding consumer choice by using traffic and location data for big data analytics, IoT (Internet of Things) and connected driving services, said Lise Fuhr, director general of ETNO, the European telecoms lobby.The review of the so-called e-privacy law will also require web browsers to ask users upon installation whether they want to allow websites to place cookies on their browsers. A previous leaked version would have forced browsers to set the default settings as not allowing cookies.Its up to our people to say yes or no, said Andrus Ansip, Commission vice-president for the digital single market.Cookies are placed on web surfers computers and contain bits of information about the user, such as what other sites they have visited or where they are logging in from. They are widely used by companies to deliver targeted ads to users.Online advertisers have warned that overly strict rules would undermine many websites ability to fund themselves and keep offering free services. They say the data they use can not identify the user and is therefore low risk, making asking for consent every time too onerous.It will particularly hit those companies that ... find it most difficult to talk directly to end users and what I mean by that is tech companies that operate in the background and sort of facilitate the buying and selling of advertising rather than the ones that the user directly engages with, said Yves Schwarzbart, head of policy and regulatory affairs at the Internet Advertising Bureau.Companies falling foul of the new law will face fines of up to 4% of their global turnover, in line with a separate data protection law set to enter into force in 2018.The proposal will need to be approved by the European Parliament and member states before becoming law.

0.9,"Mumbai: Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL) is likely to report an increase in its quarterly profit, as stronger petrochemical margins offset weaker earnings from its refining business. 
				   
				Consolidated net profit is likely to increase to Rs7,282.5 crore on a revenue of Rs63,669.9 crore for the three months ended on 30 September, according to a Bloomberg poll of six analysts. In the year-earlier quarter, the company reported a consolidated net profit of Rs6,720 crore and revenue of Rs75,117 crore. RIL will announce its second-quarter earnings on Thursday. After six consecutive sequential earnings increases, we expect RILs standalone earnings to moderate 2% quarter-on-quarter (QoQ), mainly due to weaker refining. But, RIL may surprise again. We expect another record petchem EBIT, said Nomura Research in a 7 October note to clients. Ebit stands for earnings before interest and taxes and is an indication of a companys profitability. RILs refining and marketing business, which accounts for over 75% of revenue and more than 60% of profit, could be hurt due to lower refining margins.Analysts expect RILs gross refining margin (GRM) to be $9.5-10 per barrel. GRM is the realization from turning every barrel of crude oil into finished products. We estimate GRM to be down 10% QoQ (quarter on quarter) while throughput 7% higher QoQ following a restart of special economic zone crude distillation unit after 20 days maintenance shutdown in May 2016. Refining EBITDA will therefore fall 6% QoQ, said Edelweiss Research in a 5 October report. During the September quarter, Singapore GRM averaged at $5.1 per barrel compared with $5 in the preceding three months.We expect RIL to report a $10 GRM versus $11.5 in 1Q, the latter including $2 of hedging & inventory gains, said Citi Research in its report dated 4 October. Earnings from the petrochemicals segment, however, are expected to rise on higher volume and wider margins. We expect petchem earnings to show strong growth led by higher volumes (some expansion projects are gradually reflecting in earnings) and improved spreads in the polymer chain, said IDFC Securities in a report dated 5 October. On the exploration and production (E&P) front, which includes domestic assets and US shale gas assets, the second quarter could also be a loss-making one for RIL as crude oil and domestic gas prices are lower compared to last year. Production from the KG block is also expected to be lower. RIL is likely to report losses in a small EBIT profit on domestic E&P. US shale will continue to remain loss-making. Crude oil and domestic gas prices are lower year-on-year. KG D6 production is expected to be down 3% year-on-year, said Bank of America Merrill Lynch in a report dated 10 October. Though RIL launched its telecom services on 5 September, the numbers are not likely to be included in September quarter. We do not expect the company to account for Jio in its consolidated results despite its launch in September as it is currently being offered to customers for free.

				In a series of tweets by Mallya on Friday morning, he claimed that the CBI made such a great drama accusing the Marans and putting them to great harm. What finally happened? Did truth prevail or CBI prevail? I am shocked at CBI allegations. All false and misconceived to say the least. What do a bunch of elite police know about business and economics?Mallya also went on to claim that he was being made a pawn in a political game. He said, Media happily being used as the pitch. I am the football. Two fiercely competitive teams National Democratic Alliance (NDA) versus United Progressive Alliance (UPA) playing. Unfortunately there are no referees. (sic)The Congress was quick to respond to Mallyas claims, stating that the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) was shielding him.The BJP started by making Mallya a Rajya Sabha MP. In 2015 the CBI had issued a lookout notice in 2015, which has now been withdrawn from all airports. Last year, before Mallya left, he had also met a senior cabinet minister who had tipped him off and helped him leave, Congress spokesperson Randeep Surjewala told Mint.Surjewala also stated that Union finance minister Arun Jaitleys budget speech which aimed at cracking down on black money launderers was a complete farce, with the party being completely dishonest in its approach towards cracking down on Mallya.Under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) an offenders assets can be confiscated and attached. Why has that not been done? The FMs speech means nothing if the party is being dishonest when it comes to prosecuting the ilk of Mallya and Lalit Modi. The party helped Mallya escape to foreign shores, where he gets money in his offshore account with the party complicit in this, Surjewala added.The BJP, however, remained silent on the matter.The party will not comment on any of these allegations or issues while the Parliament is in session. It is against legislation to comment on matters which may come up in Parliament and then we will take a call on this, said a senior BJP leader, requesting anonymity.Late on Thursday night, Mallya also alleged that the CBI was systematically framing him in a conspiracy.The CBI selectively releasing e-mails to media which are being taken out of context and distorted to make allegations against me and UPA regime, he wrote on Twitter.The CBI however, told Mint that this was a desperate attempt by Mallya to wade out of the airtight charges that had been made against him.Charges have been filed and we have now set the ball rolling for his extradition. If Vijay Mallya is not to blame, then why did he run away from the country? We are confident that the United Kingdom will extradite him because we have a very strong case against him.

0.01,"Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL) had reported a premium of $3.1 per barrel over the Singapore gross refining margin (GRM) for the March quarter. For the June quarter, that premium was expected to expand further. However, the reported premium of $6.5 per barrel, the highest in the last eight years according to RIL, far exceeded Street estimates. Most analysts had estimated the companys GRM to be in the range of $9.5-10 per barrel. On the contrary, RILs GRM in the June quarter came in at $11.5 per barrel.
				   
				There are a couple of reasons for this outperformance. One, as Alok Agarwal, chief financial officer at RIL, said, We did have a build-up in inventory towards the end of last quarter and we were able to liquidate that inventory at better prices than at the end of the last quarter. Secondly, middle distillates, which include gas oil (diesel) and aviation fuel and account for nearly 45% of the companys product slate, performed better. Our crude sourcing was competitive too, pointed out Agarwal.Even as the GRM beat is strong, not everybody is impressed. Theres no point in taking a call on GRM alone, said independent analyst S.P. Tulsian. He added that looking at inventory at the end of the last fiscal year, it is likely that inventory gains, perhaps to the extent of approximately $2.5 per barrel, are included in the reported GRM.Nonetheless, the fact remains that a strong performance by the refining segment did help the company beat analysts estimates by a good margin. But its worth remembering that the RIL stock has already gone up in the past five trading sessions.Moreover, the performance of other business segments is not very encouraging. Sure, petrochemicals business Ebit (earnings before interest and tax) margin improved to 14.9% from 14% in the March quarter. But that was largely in line with Street estimates. While the oil and gas business reported an Ebit of Rs.48 crore compared with a loss in the March quarter, it hardly moves the needle for RIL. Losses of US shale operations increased.Stand-alone revenue declined about 19%, reflecting the decline in broader crude oil prices, while net profit increased about 19% to Rs.7,548 crore. That was because of a 628 basis point jump in operating profit margin to 20%, while depreciation cost declined 3% and other income increased 18.5%, helping net profit growth. A basis point is 0.01%.What of the stock? RIL shares have underperformed the benchmark Sensex since it announced its March quarter numbers. Some reasons for the underperformance can be attributed to the fact that the company had guided analysts about delays in commissioning of its downstream projects, lower refining margin environment and lack of clarity on the timelines of its telecom launch.Currently, one RIL share trades at about 11 times its estimated earnings per share for this fiscal year. Of course, news flow on the telecom launch will be an important measure to track and so will developments on commissioning of downstream expansion projects. In the near term, what is worrisome is that Singapore refining margins have hardly improved. Even as RIL delivered a great beat in the June quarter, the pertinent questions are whether that will sustain. As of now, analysts dont see inventory gains recurring for the current quarter.The crude spreads that are relevant to RILs refineries have contracted in June and July 2016 from levels in April and May 2016, according to ICICI Securities Ltd. This contraction of light-heavy crude spread would hit RILs GRM if it sustains, wrote analysts from ICICI Securities in a note on 7 July. Unfortunately for investors, it could well mean that the robust GRM performance seen last quarter may not be repeated in the current one.The writer does not have positions in the companies discussed here.",2016-07-16,BYyVceR6MiTJTGQ0FWjPEK,"Most analysts had estimated its gross refining margins to be $9.5-10 per barrel; on the contrary, RILs margins in the June quarter came in at $11.5 per barrel

0.67,"Vodafone Group Plc said it was hit by an impairment charge of 6.38 billion ($6.86 billion) with respect to its investment in India. After accounting for a deferred tax asset, the net impairment charge was lower at 5 billion. A little over six years ago, it had written down goodwill and other intangible assets by £2.3 billion ($3.33 billion).
				   
				On both occasions, the company cited an increase in competitive pressure, leading to a reassessment of profit growth projections, which led to large write-downs in the carrying value of Vodafones India assets. Its worthwhile noting here that Vodafone had paid a hefty premium while acquiring the India operations in 2007, and it isnt surprising that the bloated value of intangible assets have to be periodically written down.Even so, Vodafones impairment charge this time around looks fairly high, at more than double the previous one. Note that so far this year, market capitalizations of Bharti Airtel Ltd and Idea Cellular Ltd have fallen by around $2 billion and $3.8 billion, respectively, reflecting the large value erosion in the sector. As such, the large write-down only underscores the troubles the sector is facing. Six years ago, when the previous impairment charge was taken by Vodafone, it had assumed Ebitda (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization) growth of 17.5% on an average in the five years till March 2015. Interestingly, organic profit growth ranged 15-20% during this period, although it fell sharply to 4.1% in fiscal year 2015-16. With the entry of Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd, sluggish growth rates are expected to continue. The growth assumptions for the current impairment testing assume Ebitda growth of 7.8% on an average in the next five years. A new entrant has recently launched free trial services for an extended time period and commercial price plans that were at a significant discount to prevailing market pricing, resulting in competitive responses from other operators. This has created a high degree of uncertainty over a range of commercial planning assumptions including future pricing, profitability and market structure, the company said in a statement. This is perhaps the first official acknowledgment that Reliance Jios launch has been hugely value destructive. Strangely enough, despite the diminishing returns from the sector, large companies are increasing capital expenditure to retain market share. As a result, return ratios are falling from already low levels. The only silver lining, from an investors perspective, is that share prices of Indian telcos have already fallen sharply in recent months, and seem to be pricing in a fairly bad future.",2016-11-16,Bd3qtEbVPw0PwNRCxQwYxH,"At 6.38 billion, Vodafones impairment charge this time around looks fairly high, at more than double the previous one",07:51,"Vodafone sees sluggish growth, thanks to Reliance Jio"
0.69,"Last November, when Idea Cellular Ltd agreed to pay top dollar for Videocon Telecommunications Ltds spectrum, it looked like the much-awaited consolidation in the industry was becoming a costly exercise. But Idea Cellular has walked out of the deal, and while Videocon has found another buyer in Bharti Airtel Ltd, valuations have come crashing down. 
				   
				Its premature to conclude that rationality has returned to the industry. Even so, the Videocon deal has some heartening takeawaysof course, for everyone except Videocon. The delay in Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltds launch means companies can breathe a bit easier. And the likelihood that the government will harmonize spectrum in 1800 megahertz (MHz) band before this years auction means that this resource may not be as scarce as was earlier feared. Idea Cellular had agreed to pay Rs.3,310 crore for contiguous 1800MHz spectrum in Gujarat and UP (West) circles. This effectively worked out to a 133% premium vis-à-vis the latest reserve price recommended by the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India. By the same measure, Videocon may have expected another Rs.3,000 crore for the remaining four circles in which it has similar spectrum. That means the amount for all six circles would be about Rs.6,610 crore. Instead, it has agreed to sell spectrum in all six circles to Bharti Airtel for a much lower amount of Rs.4,428 crore. While Videocon has settled for lower valuations vis-à-vis last November, the sale price represents a 100% premium to its purchase price. Another way to look at the deal is that Bharti Airtel is acquiring the spectrum at 34% of the last discovered price for 900MHz spectrum in these circles, whereas Idea Cellular had agreed to pay as much as 55% for the two circles it had agreed to buy. According to analysts at JM Financial Institutional Securities Ltd, the price of 1800 relative to the price of 900 was 35% in A-category circles and 47% in metro circles in the March 2015 auctions. Bharti Airtel, therefore, appears to have struck a reasonable deal, especially keeping in mind that the entire spectrum is contiguous and hence suitable for deploying 4G services. The six circles contribute to 23% of Bharti Airtels revenue. Also, it will now have 4G spectrum in 19 circles, versus 15 earlier. Bhartis 4G-1800 spectrum footprint is now slightly better than that of Reliance Jio, JM Financials analysts wrote in a 17 March note. Interestingly, while Bharti Airtel shares rose 1.3% on the National Stock Exchange on Thursday, those of Idea Cellular gained 3.15%. Of course, investors will be relieved that Idea Cellular backed out of the expensive deal. And as far as the gaps in its 4G footprint go, the auction later this year is likely to provide opportunities to fill them. Besides, as pointed out earlier, with the delay in Reliance Jios launch, companies have been able to breathe a bit easy. Having said all this, the industry is far from being out of the woods. At best, Idea Cellular may have ended up saving about Rs.1,000 crore, which isnt much, considering that it had paid as much as Rs.30,000 crore in the March 2015 auction. Recent data suggests that growth in data revenue is falling and is calling to question the high amounts firms have spent on spectrum purchases and network roll-outs.

				Growth in both revenue and profit declined, largely because of a higher-than-expected drop in realizations, but also because of lower volume growth.The big surprise in the results was the sharp deceleration in growth in the data segment. In the case of Idea Cellular Ltd, data revenue grew 45% year-on-year last quarter, a sharp drop from the over 80% growth just two quarters ago. Price realizations in the segment fell by as high as 17% year-on-year. For Bharti Airtel Ltd, data realizations fell 13.1% last quarter, much higher than the 5.6% drop reported in the September quarter.Idea Cellulars management said in a note to investors, (there is) intense pressure on the mobile data realized rate, as wireless broadband consumer demand growth is slower than increased supply from operators launching/expanding 3G/4G footprints. Its quite disheartening, from an investors perspective, that this is happening even ahead of Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltds launch. Supply will increase manifold when Jio launches its services commercially.Incumbents such as Idea and Bharti have spent vast amounts of money in purchasing spectrum, and have stepped up capital expenditure to capitalize on the data opportunity. The December quarter results suggest that data is proving to be a drag rather than a money-spinner. Analysts at Kotak Institutional Equities wrote in a note to clients, We are slightly concerned about the data volume trajectory, especially in the context of accelerated 3G/4G network rollouts by the operators. We, however, think it is too early to call out a definitive trend here.Investors are taking a very grim view of the future.

				Lately its been gored by Mukesh Ambanis Reliance Industries Ltd., whose mobile carrier Jio is literally giving away services and has quickly grabbed 70 million customers.That Vodafone is in talks to combine its Indian business with Idea Cellular Ltd is at least a sign that something can be done to cut the British companys exposure to the country.

That brings the value of the Vodafone mobile business closer to Ideas market capitalization, which jumped more than 25% to $5.2 billion on Monday (from $4.1 billion).If a deal is finalized, Vodafone could then sell down its stake in the merged company over time, hopefully at a better price if its better able to withstand the heat from Jio. There will be synergies too from combining operational and capital spending.ALSO READ | Ideas shares surge on Vodafone merger talks, so do AirtelsPlus Vodafone still has the option of selling its Indus shares to Bharti, which owns 42% of the joint venture, according to Bernsteins Dhananjay Mirchandani.If Vodafone boss Vittorio Colao can engineer those twin moves in India, shareholders would probably accept a reasonable retreat from a painful situation.

0.56,"Mumbai: Naffa Innovations Pvt. Ltd, a mobile payments company that operates as ToneTag, said it has received an undisclosed sum from a clutch of investors. 
				   
				The investors include Nasscom foundation trustee Arun Seth, Manipal Global Education chairman T.V. Mohandas Pai, Snapdeals ex-chief product officer Anand Chandrasekaran and Gencoval Strategic Services Pvt. Ltd chairman Deepak Ghaisas. The round also saw participation from some overseas investors.The Bengaluru-based firm said it has raised more money than its previous funding of $1 million from Reliance Venture Asset Management in August 2015, without giving details. ToneTag plans to use the funds to expand its user base and grow the number of merchants that accept cashless transactions.  ToneTag enables contactless digital transactions on mobile phones, card swiping machines, automated teller machines and other payment enabling devices with a software update, without the need to make hardware changes. ToneTag has also partnered with banks and digital wallets, including HDFC Bank Ltd, ICICI Bank Ltd, Freecharge and Airtel, that cumulatively have a user base of more than 40 million. These companies have integrated their mobile applications with ToneTag software. The user can make contactless payment using any mobile phone through such mobile applications that are ToneTag enabled. ToneTag is enabling a customer experience of paying contactless, an experience similar to paying like cash but faster and more secure than cards and other payment systems like QR Codes. This is a technology that plays to the natural power of the phone, which all phones are inbuilt with, a speaker and mike and, hence, ToneTag will work with every phone not just smartphones, said Seth.

0.17,"The goods and services tax (GST) will undoubtedly give India a facelift on the taxation front. Of course, the suspense over the rate at which GST will be levied remains.
				   
				While it is difficult to quantify the impact on various sectors until the government announces the final GST rate, analysts and economists are assuming a standard rate of 17-18%.If that happens, then companies in the manufacturing sector are expected to benefit, while those in the services sector stand to lose.Also read: GST: The road ahead for industry

Of course, even though the bill has been passed in the current session, it will be another couple of years until GST is fully rolled out. As such, its premature to conclude how this reform will impact stock prices in the near term. In any case, there are various other factors that impact stock prices, and while GST is an important reform, analysts are more keen about indicators of the economic recovery.The winners 
1) Automobiles: The auto sector is likely to emerge as a winner from GST implementation, provided the rate is below the total tax incidence for the sector (>27%). GST is expected to lead to lower prices for the end user and thus boost demand. Companies to benefit include Maruti Suzuki India Ltd and Mahindra and Mahindra Ltd. Both stocks have outperformed the market so far this fiscal year. Analysts believe some impact of GST could well be priced in at current levels.2) Multiplexes: Multiplex companies pay around 25% of the average revenue per user (average ticket price + food and beverage spends, or F&B per head) as taxes, according to Kotak Institutional Equities. This is in three broad areas(a) entertainment tax on net ticket sales, (b) Value-added tax (VAT) on F&B, and (c) service tax on input costs for which there is no set-off available. No wonder, GST is expected to reduce the tax burden and improve the Ebitda (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) margin. Stocks of PVR Ltd and Inox Leisure Ltd have increased 50% and 30%, respectively, so far in FY17, suggesting the shares are factoring in most of the positives. Of course, there are other factors that are driving these shares.3) FMCG: If the GST rate is less than or equal to 18%, then it should be positive for most consumer goods companies, point out analysts at Citigroup. Of course, much depends on which exemptions are retained and which of the current excise benefits are grandfathered. In addition, there will be gains from warehouse rationalization and a better competitive position vis-à-vis unorganized firms. But gains arent expected to be massive and will occur gradually; as such, stocks may not react dramatically just because the GST bill is passed.If cigarettes attract a higher tax incidence under the GST regime, then it will have an adverse impact on companies such as ITC Ltd.4) Logistics: Supply chain management is expected to get a boost and transit time will reduce. Further, interstate trade barriers would reduce and eventually result in better interstate commerce. Consolidation of warehousing facilities is expected. Stocks that may benefit include Container Corp. of India Ltd and Transport Corp. of India Ltd. Citis analysts point out that the better operating environment could lead Gateway Distriparks Ltd to enter the domestic business.5) Cement: The anticipated 18% GST rate is far lower than what cement companies are paying currently, and analysts expect cement makers to pass on the benefits to consumers as demand continues to remain weak. Whether this alone will help revive demand is another matter altogether.6) Retail: The opportunity to set off input tax credit on rent is expected to aid margin expansion. But retail companies are facing other problems. Shoppers Stop Ltds stock has underperformed the benchmark Sensex this year, as underlying demand remains weak and like-to-like sales growth has been lacklustre.Also read: GST reforms: Are companies prepared?

The losers
As mentioned earlier, services-related sectors are expected to be negatively impacted, as they may have to shell out higher taxes than what they are currently paying. Service tax rate is currently at about 15%.1) Telecom: The moderate rise in tax outgo could hit demand and revenues. But there would be a simultaneous set-off of taxes (Cenvat, or central VAT) paid on certain capex inputs. So, the impact would be marginal. But telcos have bigger problems. Data volumes are slowing and the Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd launch can worsen matters.2) Consumer staples and discretionary: Many consumer staples currently have low indirect tax. Hence, GST will be negative for companies in food processing, bakery, edible oil, dairy segments and personal care items. Quick service restaurants too will be adversely impacted. Kotak Institutional Equities sees some impact on Britannia Industries Ltd and ITC.

What is it? The estimated combined revenue of a proposed merger of Vodafone India and Idea Cellular.Why is it important? The all-share merger will create Indias largest telecom company, larger than the Rs-50,008-crore-earning Bharti Airtel. Debt on both the companies books and likely losses incurred from the tariff-reduction race started by Reliance Jio are being seen as triggers for the move. It looks like a much needed consolidation boost in the 22-circle Indian telecom market, as seen from the stock gains of Indian telecom operators yesterday ranging 8-10% with Idea gaining a record 26%.Tell me more: The merged entry would still have to address, in many markets, the telecom regulators anti-monopoly restrictions of owning no more than 50% of spectrum in a band and 25% of available spectrum in a circle (or geographic market). 1 dayWhat is it? Number of days to go before the RBI-mandated daily ATM withdrawal limit of Rs 10,000 is removed, from February 1.Why is it important? The first sign of reverting to pre-demonetisation days of cash management was made with RBIs circular removing the ATM limit. Two weeks ago, RBI signalled its ease in handling cash by expanding the limit to Rs 10,000 from Rs 4,500. The Rs 24,000-weekly limit on savings-bank withdrawal, however, stays put, but restrictions on current account, cash credit and overdraft accounts will be removed. Tell me more: RBI mentions the savings-bank limit is under consideration for withdrawal in the near future. Banks can use their discretion to set their own operating limits at ATMs as was the practice before old Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes were withdrawn.42What is it? The number of cases the Income Tax (IT) department registered nationwide under the recently-enforced Benami Transactions Act.Why is it important? Warnings in public advertisements by the IT department against depositing unaccounted old currency in someone elses bank account anonymously are materialising now. The Benami Acts section 24 has been invoked for 87 notices, for attaching bank accounts with crores of rupees of such dubious deposits and an immovable property.Tell me more: These cases, if proven true, would attract a heavy penalty and a rigorous jail-term of a maximum of seven years. 4What is it? The number of new administrators appointed by the Supreme Court to the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI).Why is it important? The neutral committee headed by former Comptroller and Auditor General of India (CAG), and the current Chairman of Banks Board Bureau, Vinod Rai, will pave the path to reform the embattled BCCI, richest sporting body in India and the most profitable cricket board in the world. The team, with a mix of financial acumen, social perspective and cricketing enthusiasm, is tasked with bringing in accounting rigour and good governance to a body mired in controversies, the latest being its earlier president and secretary sacked on January 3. It would also finalise the Indian Premier Leagues 10th edition besides reporting on the Lodha panel recommendations to the court.Tell me more: The other members are Vikram Limaye, managing director and CEO of IDBI Bank; former Indian womens cricket captain Diana Edulji; and historian and writer Ramchandra Guha.

The IPPB will locate these branches in postal district headquarters which would enable all the post office branches under those head offices to be served by the payments bank. With India Posts envious branch network of no less than 155,000 post offices, expanding its reach should be one of IPPBs easiest tasks.

All three bank account options will request its customers to make a Rs100 initial minimum deposit, with no minimum balance requirements. Both Safal and Sugam need KYC (know your customer) details for verification and minimum age of 10 years, but Saral can be opened by anyone above the age of 10 years without KYC.Interest rates have been fixed as 4.5% if the quarterly average balance is up to Rs25,000, 5% if it is between Rs25,000 and Rs50,000, and 5.5% if above Rs50,000.There are no charges on cash withdrawals, unlike Airtel Payments Bank.Airtel Payments Bank launched, with vow to shake up old banking systemEarlier this month, Airtel Payments Bank launched nationwide operations, offering 7.25% interest on savings, which is more than the maximum of 7% paid by State Bank of India, the countrys largest bank, on fixed deposits.

0.6,"At 62, Max Group founder Analjit Singh is trim and fit and says he is at peace with himselfa state of mind achieved because he doesnt feel the need for habra any more. Translated from Punjabi, that means he is no longer in a tearing hurry, as he was 30 years ago.
				   
				In January, Analjit Singh stepped down as chairman of the group he founded in 1982 and built into a Rs15,000 crore empire, with interests in life insurance; health and allied businesses; and speciality packaging films. In August, the board of Max Life Insurance Co. Ltd signed off on a merger with HDFC Life Insurance Co. Ltd that will create Indias largest private-sector insurer, with Rs1.1 trillion in assets.The promoters of Max Financialessentially Analjit Singh, his family and related family firmswill hold a 6.5% stake in the merged company and also get a non-compete fee of Rs850 crore. Analjit Singh, who within Max Group is called BAS (short for Bhai Analjit Singh, bhai being an honorific meaning brother), doesnt like being called a promoter, preferring the term sponsor, and seems to have achieved what most business family owners can only think of wistfullya degree of detachment from the business that allows him to take decisions without any emotional baggage.Analjit Singh stands out among the top echelons of business leadership in India for his ability to spot an opportunity like he did with telecom (Singh made Rs561 crore in 1998 by selling his 41% stake in a joint venture with Hutchison Whampoa Ltd)  and insurance and healthcare early on, and  more than that to quit when on top. He ascribes that to foresight and luck; but in reality, it is the mark of a businessman who can read the tea leaves.Analjit Singh, with the reputation of a serial entrepreneur, is also exploring new businesses, including information technology, real estate and education, under Max Ventures and Industries Ltd (MVIL). In an interview at his elegant home on New Delhis tony Abul Kalam Azad Road, Analjit Singh patiently explained his philosophy of life, his current state of mind and how the two relate to his business. Edited excerpts:As a strategic businessman, what are the things you are looking at now? When you look at these opportunities, what excites you the most?
I am not so sure that people in my situation look at entrepreneurial opportunities from purely a new-world perspective, as you pointed out. I think they look at entrepreneurial and future opportunities in rather a traditional way but think of these developments as enablers.What is the traditional way?
It is perspective of the market, key differentiators, compatibility of extensive weaknesses of the individual and the firm to be able to do something like this. So, therefore, in the traditional criteria of finding these opportunities what I meant was market, differentiator, opportunities, regulation...new factor, completely new factor in the decision-making set. The market is over-crowded. Everybody is in the business of over-promising and under-delivering. Capital is no longer a constraint like it was before. To some extent, even technology is no longer a constraint to those people who have some experience and network, you can find the technology. Anything is possible. If you run a world-class airline, technology is available. So, execution is the key. Team is a big factor. Team was never a question in our mind in the past 10-15 years. Today, if I were looking to be in a big business, probably the first question that I will ask apart from market and differentiator is people and team; and then you look at these new-world solutions that you are talking about as how they can become enablers to what they can do.Besides that, this question is not so pertinent to me. I am not super-engaged to be so rattled about what am I going to do and what will be my next big play. It is not top-most of my mind.But you will do new things, right?
I will do new things, but I will say I am not besotted with it anymore. My interest is more to tame myself and tame my mind and tame my life. Do you know this word habra? I have no habra.Were you like that when you did the diversification?
Of course not! Thirty years ago, I was always in a rush.If you forget about the future for now and look at the past 16 years, what are the things that you have picked up?
I dont call myself a promoter. I prefer the word sponsor. I think if a sponsor does not have an affinity with the business, that business unless by luck things take-off, I think that business drags. The affinity of a sponsor to a particular business segment is very important. If (Bharti Airtel Ltd founder) Sunil Mittal did not have an affinity for telecom or for technology, Airtel would not have been what it is today (Indias biggest phone services provider). If I did not have an affinity for being in the businesses of life and, therefore, focus on healthcare and insurance for 15-16 years, it wouldnt have worked.Affinity and focus leads to execution, passion capital, heavy-lifting, good team equals to success. Therefore, you can apply that mantra to anythingold world or new world. What would you call an old-world business? Pick anything. If I say to myself that I am going to leave everything in my life and get into steel and cement, I will find a new way of doing it and I will be successful in 5-7 years. I will find a way because the need for steel and cement is not gone. If you do it as another unit with the traditional way and traditional people, it is a recipe for disaster. So, we have to find an IndiGo (Indias biggest airline) way of getting in steel or cement. IndiGo is a very good example of what I am saying. What is the revolution and reinvention of being in the airline business? People have been in the airline business. They are in the airline business. They will be in the airline business, but most companies fail. So, why is IndiGo successful? Do you think (IndiGo co-founder) Rahul Bhatia goes and fixes the tyres of the plane every day? No. But somewhere between Aditya (Ghosh, IndiGo president) and him, the way they work is set. So, the way we work in insurance and healthcare is set, and everybody then would perform to that tune. Thats because you have affinity. Thats a clear lesson and experience that I can share.Somebody asked me the other day that you are not even now non-executive chairman of your companies. I am of the MVIL (Max Ventures India Ltd) because I am having fun again after 30 years to nurture a new company. Of those, you are of Vodafone.My point there was: to be a non-executive chairman of a company where you are a sponsor is very different from a non-executive chairman of a company where you are not a sponsor. My remake, role, life, expectations, contact, engagement, communication has to be very different if I am a non-executive chairman of a Max company. The deliverables and expectations are different when it comes to  being non-executive chairman of Vodafone. I am not a sponsor. They dont have the same expectation.When do you as a promoter decide that it is time that you should become a sponsor? Let us assume that this second wave of successful diversification that you did were not successful, would you still be saying all this?
So, in a way, it also gets linked to your expectations from future and living with disappointments from your past. Thats in a way what you are saying. I think the honest answer has to be that if the outcomes were not as exciting as they have been, I think, I would have not been as restful in my mind about it as I am appearing right now. I think thats possibly the case, but it also means in my current way of thinking that I would have to work harder at myself to become restful about the disappointments of the past.So, luckily for meand luck is a factor or the blessing that I havethe way I see it from nature and everything else is that these have moved reasonably in tandem. If they had not, the stretch would have been more and one would have to work harder to overcome those disappointments.Is there someone else in your fraternity who has done this really well? Is there a role model?
I wont go to the extent of saying whether I have a role model. I wont say that I am looking at somebody and say look how he did it. But I can tell you who has done it and done it very successfully. He is Vikram Lal (promoter of Eicher Motors Ltd). He is very restful and peaceful as a person. Look what has happened to Eicher. He wanted a particular life for some reason and he went after it and he has got it.I so solidly believe in impermanence that for me to be attached to a business, in this case, life insurance, it is stupid to be attached to it. When life is impermanent then what is this stigma about a business being permanent. Today, when you look at it, the power of this sector in this business is moving to banks. Whether these (insurance) companies are going to be profitable or not will not be because our premiums will get higher. We have the highest persistency (a measure of policy renewals) in the country84%. It is unheard of. The No. 2 company is 63%. So, I cant have more persistency in this business. The banks are now controlling distribution virtually. So, the only way to improve profitability is expense management. So, power shifting from agency to bankers, premiums not going up, expense management, regulators everywhere in this world are tightening the screws on the companies. Solvency margin, shareholder profits, expense allowance and disallowance, participating account versus shareholder account. No. 3 some sort of going back to expense management and market share, some sort of geographies have emerged for different companies. We are very strong in Gujarat; Gujarat is our second or third largest territory. But, more or less, we are more strong in the north and the south than we are in the west or east. HDFC (Life) is more strong in the west and the south than they are in the north. So, if you take the bank they are, you take the opportunity to consolidate and, therefore, cut some unessential costs and you take the link and fourth, product. In our time, we were heavily into protection and savings products. Even today, 80% of our business comes from protection and savings products, not from ULIPs (unit-linked insurance plans) and the like. HDFC is other way around, may be two-third or one-third.These are the four things that I saw writing on the wall about. And I have to tell you that when as a sponsor, among the 23 or 24 companies that are in life (insurance), if you take the balance sheet of the sponsor, we must be one of the smallest, I think. So from being in that position to sitting at No.3 of 23-24 with all the names you know sitting below us, you can get spoilt; and then, one fine day, because of these four factors, nobody gives you notice of failure in life like you never get notice of death.The same is in this business, some things just happen, and they change and then all of a sudden you say, oh shit what has happened?Six months ago, we were like this. And you come from 3 to 6 to 8 to 9. I dont want to take that chance; but then, it will go back to the question you asked me that if at the end of all this it was not good, would you have felt the same thing and I would have said no and I would have to start again, building again. I can see it happening, but my responsibility is I must not let it happen. Here is my opportunity that God has sent to me, I must take it.But you do take impulsive decisions? You do take decisions on the basis of your instinct?
Of course, you do.In South Africa, for instance.
Of course, I did. But hang on, yes and no. The impulsive decision that was taken about South Africa was not for business. The impulsive decision was to want to be there and enjoy the location. Like I may have a home. So, that was the impulsive decision. When it started to go away from becoming a holiday home or retreat to business, then I am very conscious, not impulsive. So, today that operation is being run exactly like any company of the Max group, with a board, people, CEOs, accountability, targets, budgets, matrix and data.Is it a part of the Max group?
No, no, private. Max has nothing to do with it.Could you elaborate a little bit, what is it about?
It is about hospitality, lifestyle, hotels, rooms, agriculture, plums, wines, almonds, wine-making, selling wines, three hotels, beer. We have a similar property in the UK. The first property is Linthwaite (Lake District Hotel, Linthwaite House), which is in the UK. So, we will grow in the UK. We have just acquired it in April. On 25 April, we took over.Whats the vision for it?
I have always wanted to be in the hospitality business. When I started vision 2000 of Max, I picked four areas: it was insurance, healthcare, education and hospitality. When we got cracking on insurance and healthcare, we did not have five rupees, or five minutes or five calories of energy to invest in anything other than insurance and healthcare; so we left it at that. In a way, Antara (homes for senior citizens) and remotely Vana (wellness resort) were born out of this idea of hospitality. And now, I am starting my life in education. Education is one of them, but it is a little too premature to talk about. In education, we have started some work. Are we engaged in it? Yes, but what are we going do, I dont know. But we have decided to be in that sector, so I dont know whether its 0 to 11 or KG to 16.Is someone thinking about this?
Yes. Very much. But just now, in August, its too soon for me to say whether its going to be Boeing or Airbus or north only or all India or only abroad... But it will be top three. I just like that expression of top three. And it should be, otherwise whats the point?Why are you interested in the real estate business?
I have a bit of khurak (itch) here. Actually, my grandfather was in the contracting business. That was my great grandfathers business in Pakistan. The bhai family were contractors. They built the road from India to Burma as a case in point. So, even now, you go to Lahore and all, and you will see a lot of buildings built by them. People in the street remember them as a family. So, I have a khurak for civil, real estate and stuff. I like land. I like construction, I like design. I like building. Every time the economy is on the cusp, and every time we talk about India being the next big thing... there are sections which are being talked about such as manufacturing, real estate, education... Do you see the economy like that?
I do and on the manufacturing side, I cant tell you anything today. I hope I can tell you in 60 days. We will, if all goes well, we will be in that space, in the prime ministers central part of his vision... Make in India. I will give you a beautiful project, if it succeeds, I dont know, I cant tell you today, we are working on it. I cant tell you what it is today. But if it succeeds, Mr. (Narendra) Modi will use this as an example of Make in India.Manufacturing is huge right? Its like a huge umbrella.
Our manufacturing space is only in one sector, which is polymers area. I am talking about that area, I am not talking about planes or furniture or phones or cars. Lets see. See, we never looked at anything else all these years. Thats why I coined this expression that I will look now at WWOBwider world of business. Education is that. Differentiated real estate is that. Investing is that. Everybody did investment. Other than financial services companies, people didnt use investing as a business. And you dont have to be financial investor to invest. So, investing will be a vertical of ours. Could be in shoes, could be in water, could be in plants.Do you see growth opportunities in the healthcare business?

0.57,"Investors in Aditya Birla Nuvo Ltd had been hounding it with one questionwhen will the financial services business be demerged and listed as a separate entity? The company would typically dismiss this, saying some of these businesses were still small and needed the backing of a large firm such as Nuvo. 
				   
				The company has now decided to demerge the financial services business and list it. But instead of ending up with a leaner corporate structure, the Aditya Birla Group has made things far more complicated, by merging Nuvo with Grasim Industries Ltd. Besides, the complicated restructuring will increase the promoter groups stake in the cash cow cement business and decrease its ownership of the cash guzzling telecom business.Before the demerger, Nuvo will be merged into Grasim, which means investors of both companies will be saddled with a myriad of new businesses they earlier did not have any exposure to. The groups chairman, Kumar Mangalam Birla, said in a press conference that the merger, along with the demerger, will create value for shareholders. But on the contrary, with an increasing number of businesses ending up under one holding company, value could get destroyed. The only silver lining for existing shareholders is a holding in the to-be-listed financial services firm. The new behemoth that arises out of the merger will have so many diverse interests, most investors are likely to shun it. After all, each of the interesting parts of these businesses will be separately listedUltraTech Cement Ltd for the cement business, Idea Cellular Ltd for the telecom business and finally the newly listed financial services business. Investors may steer clear of a firm where a holding company discount is applied to so many large businesses.For perspective, Grasims 60.25% stake in UltraTech Cement itself is valued at less than 70% of its market value because of the holding company discount. Until now, for Grasim shareholders, there was at least an arbitrage opportunity, which would come into play when share prices fell vis-à-vis UltraTech Cements share price. In Nuvos case, some investors found the play on the financial services story compelling. There are hardly any reasons to invest in the merged company, certainly not after the financial services firm lists. Interestingly enough, the promoter holding in Grasim will rise from 31.3% to around 38.8% post the restructuring. Their ownership in the financial services and telecom businesses will decline. Minority shareholders of Grasim, on the other hand, have to settle for a lower stake in the cement business and take on exposure to the telecom and financial services business. Since the promoter group is considered the most informed investor, a natural question these investors will have is, Why should we do the opposite of what the promoters are doing? Nuvos shareholders, a far smaller piece in the whole puzzle in terms of their value of shareholding, get to enjoy the same ride as the promoters. But again, they too end up with an investment in a holding company. All told, it is not clear that the merger will add value, and minority investors may well protest.",2016-08-11,GqVgitnAuvR4RQQirAUeGO,"Instead of ending up with a leaner corporate structure, the Aditya Birla Group has made things far more complicated, by merging Nuvo with Grasim Industries

				In  a recent paper Internet shutdowns cost countries $2.4 billion last year by Brookings Institution, a non-profit public policy organization, author Darrel M. West analyses the economic impact of temporary internet shutdowns. West examines 81 short-term shutdowns in 19 countries over the past year and estimates their impact on the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) of those nations. Based upon this analysis, West finds that between 1 July 2015 and 30 June 2016, internet shutdowns cost at least $2.4 billion in GDP globally.India faces the highest economic loss at $968 million followed by  $465 million loss in Saudi Arabia, Morocco ($320 million) , Iraq ($209 million), the Republic of the Congo ($72 million) , Pakistan ($69 million), Syria ($48 million), and Turkey ($35 million), among other places. These are conservative estimates that consider only reductions in economic activity and do not account for tax losses or drops in investor, business, and consumer confidence.West argues in the paper that internet disruptions are creating significant detrimental impacts on economic activity in a number of nations around the world. He says: As the digital economy expands, it will become even more expensive for nations to shut down the internet. Without coordinated action by the international community, this damage is likely to accelerate in the future and further weaken global economic development.Internet disruptions over the past yearWest finds that there is a rising trend of governments disrupting the internet and quotes a study by University of Washington researchers who identified 606 occasions between 1995 and the first part of 2011 where 99 different governments deliberately interfered with the normal operation of the internet.To ascertain the number of times disruptions have happened in the past year, West collected cases from internet searches, English-based news coverage, and lists compiled by non-profit organizations that track such disruptions. Overall, he cites  81 disruptions in 19 countries during this period. This includes 22 in India, Iraq (22), non-ISIS controlled parts of Syria (8), Pakistan (6), Turkey (3), and 2 each in Bangladesh, Brazil, North Korea, the Republic of the Congo, Uganda, and Vietnam, among other places.West also identified six categories of disruptions: national internet, sub-national internet, national mobile internet, sub-national mobile internet, national app/service, and sub-national app/service (including VoIP). The impact on Gross Domestic ProductOverall, these disruptions cost countries a total of at least $2.4 billion over the past year, with impact ranging the highest in India at  $968 million. These disruptions lasted 753 days in total across all countries. West also cites a number of notable internet disruptions. One took place in Saudi Arabia in May 2016. Citing economic damage to telecommunications providers, the government blocked functionality of a number of apps related to VoIP, texting, and instant messaging; those impacted included WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger, and Skype, among others. The move cost the country $465 million in GDP. India, for instance, shut down mobile internet services in Rohtak on February 19, 2016 in response to street demonstrations in Rohtak and Jhajjar. The disruption lasted more than a week and cost $190 million. Law enforcement officials explained that this has been done so that rumours are not spread as this could lead to the situation getting out of hand.  In Brazil, a local judge ordered telecommunications companies to block access to WhatsApp on May 2, 2016 following an earlier shutdown in December 2015. The May shutdown blocked access to the predominant communications service across the country for a day and cost the Brazilian economy $39 million. West concludes by saying that government officials in many countries around the world appear increasingly comfortable blocking access to online services and apps, despite the significant economic and social damage that internet service disruptions bringto their countries. Whether their ostensible motivations are public security or political self-preservation, government officials should understand the wide-ranging and destructive consequences of these moves. Shutting down accessto popular services or to the whole interneteven for a short period of timeundermines economic growth, puts lives in jeopardy, separates people from friends and family, and erodes confidence in the governments that takesuch drastic and ill-advised steps. West said in an email interaction:Government leaders need to understand they shoot their economies in the foot when they disrupt the internet. Shutdowns harm small and large businesses and lead to big economies losses. As the digital economy grows, these costs will accelerate.",2016-10-14,HBa7uLVF6xO7mKbAIN9X5L,"Internet shutdowns, caused due to six categories of disruptions, cost about $2.4 billion in GDP globally between 1 July 2015 and 30 June 2016, says Brookings Institution ",14:21,How much does internet shutdown cost India?

				A significant portion of the credit for making space cool again goes to the disruption of the space industry over the last few years by private enterprise. The poster boy of this bright new space is, of course, Elon Musk and SpaceX. From slashing the cost of launches by landing the first stages of rockets through putting together plans to colonize Mars, he has already shown he has what it takes to define space for tomorrow. Over the years, national space agencies like Nasa, Isro, Roscosmos, CNSA, Jaxa and ESA have been at the forefront of pushing humanity into space. That is changing.There are parallels to where space is now and where the Internet was a few decades back. For many years, the Internet remained a project inside the US government establishment. I dont need to expand on how the opening up of the Internet to entrepreneurs changed the world. Space is at a similar juncture where private enterprise is starting to make its presence felt. The next decade is when much of this shift will be under way. The attraction of space tourism has been central to the coverage and narrative that has followed private enterprise in the field. That is only natural, given the presence of media-friendly figures like Virgin Groups Richard Branson working on space tourism projects. But the real innovation driven by private enterprise is going to be in other, less glamorous but equally fascinating areas. Think small satellites, for instance. As The Economist points out, advancements in smartphones and other consumer electronics provide a wealth of ready-made technologies that can enable a CubeSat (a type of nano satellite) to perform many of the functions of a satellite a hundred times heavier and much larger, but at substantially less cost. That will revolutionize everything from weather prediction to remote sensing to telecommunications, and help bring the power of technology to billions around the world in a much deeper and more meaningful way.Then there is the opportunity to develop technology that will satiate human appetite for everything from energy to precious metals. Globally, companies like Deep Space Industries have been talking up asteroid mining. An article in the technology publication New Atlas says, Studies indicate that an asteroid 1,000 metres (3,280 ft) across could yield about 100,000 tonnes of platinumwhich already has miners in South Africa worried because we only mine a measly 130 tonnes of the metal on Earth each year.Helium 3 is another resource which can change how mankind powers itself. The Moon has rich deposits of the isotope, which is hard to find on Earth. If technology is developed to use this isotope for nuclear fusion, the amount of Helium 3 on the Moonaccording to Prof. Ouyang Ziyuan, the chief scientist of the Chinese Lunar Exploration Program (Clep)can solve humanitys energy demand for around 10,000 years at least. If finding ways to make that happen isnt a challenge that entrepreneurs must rise up to, what is?While the idea of space-based business evolves, India is in the middle of a revolution as well. A new generation of entrepreneurs is backing itself to change the way we live and do business. Our opportunity in space business does not start and end with cost arbitrage for foreign companies. Our obvious cost advantages must be leveraged as a catalyst to innovate in everything from designing, developing and launching smaller satellites to making bets that can make the difference in mankinds quest for newer energy sources. We at TeamIndus are happy to start the conversation, and we hope many more Indian entrepreneurs will join us on this journey.Rahul Narayan is co-founder and fleet commander of Team Indus, an aerospace research start-up, and the only Indian team competing for the $30-million Google Lunar XPRIZEThis is part of a series of articles in Mints 10th anniversary special issue that look at India 10 years from now.

0.48,"Indias largest mobile services operator, two of the largest pharmaceutical companies, a top-tier IT services firm and the second largest tower infrastructure company have chosen the buyback route to return cash to shareholders this year. This is the first time so many large companies have announced buybacks in quick succession; fiscal year 2016-17 looks set to break all prior records with regards to share repurchases. Along with three large buybacks by government-owned companies, Indian companies have announced buybacks worth over Rs.2,1000 crore so far this year.
				   
				Of course, it will be a while before buybacks topple dividends as the preferred means to return cash. According to data collated by Mint Research, S&P BSE 100 companies alone paid dividends worth Rs.1.51 trillion in FY16. (See bit.ly/29xe7dk). In the same period, the amount spent on buybacks by all listed companies was only Rs.1,800 crore.But this may well be the beginning of a trend where buybacks are used nearly as much, if not more, as dividends to return cash. Research by Credit Suisse shows that in the US, S&P 500 companies spent $572 billion on buybacks in 2015, or 1.5 times of what they spent on dividends. For a number of shareholders, buybacks trump dividends both in terms of tax efficiency and the flexibility they offer. Ironically, in India, the government seems to have overplayed its hand and magnified the relative advantages of buybacks. In the 2016-17 Union budget, finance minister Arun Jaitley introduced an additional tax of 10% on any dividend income of more than Rs.10 lakh. Dividend distribution tax already amounted to 20.4% of payouts.For stocks that have been held for over a year, the buyback route entails a tax outgo of only 0.1%, which is essentially the securities transaction tax (STT) applicable for the transaction. Since 1 July 2015, Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) has allowed listed companies to make tender buyback offers through stock exchanges. For such transactions, long-term capital gains tax is exempt.Earlier, when companies werent allowed to make tender buyback offers through stock exchanges, investors would end up paying a 10% long-term capital gains tax. To be sure, buybacks through tender offers have picked up since FY16.For high dividend earners, the tax savings through a buyback issue are substantial. Bharti Airtel Ltd holds a 71.7% stake in Bharti Infratel Ltd. The latter has announced a buyback of Rs.2,000 crore. If the promoter tenders shares in proportion to its shareholding, it will take home more than Rs.1,400 crore after accounting for STT and other costs. If Infratel had chosen the dividend route instead, the net take home would be only around Rs.1,000 crore.There is likely to be increasing pressure from shareholders to shift to buybacks, given the tax efficiency. One likely pushback is that Sebi imposes a restriction on companies buying back sharesi.e. that they cant issue fresh equity for a period after the buyback. From a shareholders perspective, buybacks offer the flexibility of foregoing the payout by the company and staying fully invested with the company. They can do this by simply opting to not tender shares in the buyback. With dividends, there is no such option. Of course, one can always use dividend proceeds to buy additional shares, although academic studies show that reinvestment is typically rare and forms a fraction of all dividends received.Another peculiarity about buybacks is that while all shareholders are treated the same with dividends, the pricing of the buyback determines which category of shareholders benefit. Michael J. Mauboussin and Dan Callahan of Credit Suisse point out in a note titled Disbursing Cash to Shareholders, Buybacks benefit ongoing shareholders when management buys stock that is undervalued and benefit outgoing shareholders when the stock is overvalued. Since management should focus on building value per share for continuing shareholders, it should always try to buy back shares that are undervalued.This shouldnt normally matter in a tender offer, where investors can participate in the same proportion as their shareholding. Even so, empirical evidence shows that some shareholders fail to participate, even when they are incentivized by a substantial premium. Needless to say, investors need to keep a close eye on the pricing of the offer; but companies, too, would do well to avoid buybacks by paying a large premium.",2016-07-11,JdsOi2pXYKNjGVP8vvJUFP,"Along with three large share buybacks by government-owned companies, Indian companies have announced buybacks worth over ,2,1000 crore so far this year",01:58,Govts second dividend tax spurs buybacks
0.25,"On Saturday, 5 November, India hosted the ICANN (Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers) 57 meeting in Hyderabad. If the Internet has a backbone, ICANN is it. From its inception in 1998 until 1 October this year, it was based in and controlled by the US. That the first summit after the US ceded control was held in India makes for neat symbolism. But if New Delhi wishes India to have a significant say in global Internet governance going forwarda mustit will have to go beyond mere symbolism.
				   
				ICANNs history is a study in the tensions between traditional state power and the decentralised nature of the Internet. Back in the dark ages of the Internet when only a handful of websites existed, American computer scientist Jon Postel administered the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA). This is the body responsible for delegating and managing domain names and Internet protocol addresses globallywhat makes it possible for someone to go to the correct website when they type, say, livemint.com. In 1998, management of IANA was taken over by ICANN, a private sector, non-profit body created for this purpose. But crucially, ICANN answered to the National Telecommunications and Information Administration of the US Department of Commerce. In essence, the US government controlled vital Internet infrastructure.This has been a point of contention in recent years. To be fair, successive US governments have used their suzerainty sparingly and fairly. But other states have been understandably unwilling to bank on Washingtons goodwill and ethical fibre in this matter of global security, economic activity and development. India has been one of them. However, its stand has been confused and wrongheaded at various points. The primary point of contention has been whether a multilateral governance approachone in which national governments would be the primary stakeholders and agentsor a multi-stakeholder approach that would incorporate a variety of voices from civil society, the private sector and academia, is best suited to succeed the US.The latter wins out on several fronts. The decentralised, transnational nature of the Internet has underpinned its innovation and economic and developmental benefits. Ringfencing crucial governance issues from the multiple non-state stakeholders that have made it what it isand worse, subjecting it to the bureaucratic wrangling that is inevitable in any multilateral bodywould be highly counterproductive. But, as Arun Mohan Sukumar points out in The Wire, despite then-information technology minister Kapil Sibal paying lip service to multi-stakeholderism in 2012, the previous administration sent confusing signals, pushing at various points for a greater government role in Internet governance.Thankfully, current IT minister Ravi Shankar Prasads unequivocal statement last year about an Indian vision for the Internetone that sees multi-stakeholderism as the only way forwardshows that the Narendra Modi government has settled upon a cohesive, sensible approach. This is a pragmatic decision given that the proponents of a multilateral approach included China and Russiaand under the circumstances, Washington had made it clear it would not cede control of ICANN to an inter-governmental body. The problem, however, is that given Indias track record so far, converting its support for a multi-stakeholder model into an actionable approach that gives it a voice in shaping future outcomes is going to take some doing.    On Saturday, Prasad chided the Indian private sector for not participating in global policymaking processes related to the Internet. He was right as far as it goes. But he failed to mention that Indian involvement in generalincluding at the governmental levelhas been anemic through the years at ICANN summits and other such forums. At a time when the Modi government has explicitly recognised the transformational potential of the Internetboth economically and for quality of governancevia the Digital India initiative, New Delhi cannot afford a low level of engagement with the global policymaking apparatus that will shape its future.Perhaps the first step to redressing the current state of affairs is looking at the domestic policymaking process in Internet-related issues. A Centre for Communication Governance report, Analysing Indian Engagement at Global Internet Governance Institutions 2011-2015 by Puneeth Nagaraj and Aarti Bhavana notes that the small number of civil society, academic and government representatives who have participated in global governance forums so far have shared concerns regarding accountability, legitimacy, diversity and capacity. Thats well and goodexcept that when it comes to freedom of expression, website blocking, policy issues such as the encryption bill and the geospatial bill, and a multitude of other such issues, successive governments have been unconcerned with the need to engage civil society and technical experts adequately.The capabilities and willingness to participate in global governance at the international level will not come into existence in a vacuum. They must first be cultivated at the domestic level. The future of the Internet is too important to leave to governments alone.How should India pursue Internet governance both domestically and globally?

Larger companies reported improved compliance, with 53% of those with sales of over Rs10,000 crore spending 2% or more of profit on CSR during FY16, compared to 31% in the year earlier. Among smaller firms, 57% with sales of Rs100-500 crore and 56% with sales of Rs500-10,000 crore reported spending 2% or more. Of course, this can also be seen as a cup half empty, as there is a long way to go before a majority of companies become compliant with the 2% spending rule.

				Using a technology system he had built at Harvard Universitywhere he was at the time pursuing his PhD in computer scienceMurty was attempting to measure the actual usage of licensed and unlicensed spectrumwhich is typically used by telecom companies, TV and radio stations, as well as for technology such as Wi-Fi. He stopped every few miles, in order to validate the correctness of his research and the software he had built. What he found out during that study would lay the basis for his research into technology that is referred to as White Space Network or White-Fi. In laymans terms, White-Fi refers to unutilized television broadcast frequencies or white spaces that are potentially capable of delivering low-cost Internet connectivity to rural and remote parts of a country. What I found out during that trip was that spectrum in general is severely underutilized, says Murty. Murty jokingly recalls that at one point, he was even stopped by a state police officer, who wondered why some scrawny, brown kid was walking around suspiciously with an unusual technical device on a US highway. A vocal proponent of White-Fiwhich he believes has the potential to deliver affordable Internet connectivity to hundreds of millions of Indians across the remotest parts of the countryMurty is of the view that the Indian government needs to make a stronger push for White-Fi and does not agree with the current stand of top telcos such as Airtel and Vodafone, which have so far opposed the use of white spaces. Companies like Microsoft have also in recent months urged the government to fight for White-Fi and oppose the telecom lobby, citing the examples of countries like the US and UK where unlicensed spectrum usage has been permitted. In an interview, Murty, son of Infosys Ltd founder N.R. Narayana Murthy and a junior fellow at the Society of Fellows at Harvard University, spoke primarily on his research on White-Fi, how his work focused on architecture for dynamic spectrum access in wireless networks and other work that he is doing on the sidelines. Aside from helping manage investments for the Murthy family office, Catamaran Ventures, he has also made some angel investments under the radarincluding a small investment in Bengaluru-based start-up Floh, which is a singles network that helps urban and educated singles find life partners. Edited excerpts:What do you make of current debates around spectrum usage in India? The telcos have so far fiercely opposed the use of white spaces and unlicensed spectrum...Let me zoom back a little. Historically weve always thought of spectrum as a binary sort of thingeither somebody has exclusive access to it or nobody has exclusive access to it. So, its either licensed or unlicensed. Example of licensed, is TV, radio, cellphone companies, etc. Wi-Fi is an example of unlicensed spectrum, its the technology that Wi-Fi operates overthats one example. Wi-Fi is just a piece of technology though, not a piece of spectrum. Now, lets take an examplelets say you have a wire between your computer and the Internet. And you pump data through. Think of the wire as a pipe and data as water. The more volume of water you pump, the more data you are pumping through. But there is a limit before the pipe explodes, in some sense. So, what do you do when the pipe saturates? All you have to do is instal one more pipeor in this case, one more wire. So, in some sense you can have infinite bandwidthbecause you just keep installing more wires. And that works. But when you move to the wireless world, this is not the right analogy. The wireless world is like a highwaythe width is fixed, you cant increase the width at all. That is a limitation of nature. So, the capacity of a wireless world is boundthere is a maximum you can extract out of it. So, now you have these lanes on the highwaywhen you licence some part of the spectrum to someone, you basically say hey, this lane is yours. Nobody else can touch it. And then there is another lane which is for the public and they use Wi-Fi for it. Now, what happens is that more and more cars are getting into this lane and there is only one lane. And we start saturating this lane. What do we do? We look across at the licensed lane, which is registered to someone and we see that nobody is using it frequently and its just sitting there. But the law states that you can only use this one lane. And all this while more and more cars are coming and we feel there is scarcity. But the truth is that this is artificial scarcity. So, the work I ended up doing was to see if those unused lanes could be used without interfering with someone elses licensed lane and on how to detect the presence of others in that lane. When I detect youre coming, then I just get out and go back in the other lane. India seems to be lagging countries such as the US and the UK in terms of embracing the opportunity hereAbsolutely. India is behind in terms of thinking of new forms of spectrum usage. I do believe that is the case. If you go talk to the FCC (Federal Communications Commission) in the US and Ofcom in the UK, just look at some of the progressive things these guys are doing. In India, weve seen companies like Google and Facebook attempt moon shots with permission from the government and provide Internet access through balloon projects such as Loon to remote parts of the country. But weve surprisingly seen opposition on White-Fi. What does the government and the telecom lobby need to do on this matter? Is there a general lack of understanding of how this technology can benefit the masses? There is no one-size-fits-all solution to this problem. I dont think the answer is that telcos will solve everything. If they claim that, I dont agree with that. I dont think balloons will solve everything either. All these different technologies will play a role and theyll fit different needs. I think it will fulfil an important need. You cannot solve everything (with just White-Fi) as well. Lets assume that spectrum operated by Wi-Fi was operated by a telcoalmost certainly it wouldnt have taken off. Every time you would have turned your Wi-Fi modem on, you would pay the telco money. Today you dont pay anybody anything. So, I dont agree with the view that telcos will solve every problem. What is the potential of White-Fi in terms of connecting millions to affordable Internet? If spectrum is a good owned by the people, then the right thing is you want to raise revenue from it and at the same time want to maximize the usage of spectrum. Lets assume that you raise revenue from it and the spectrum is actually not being used. Then you have a losing proposition... I dont know if (White-Fi) can solve all (connectivity) problems, but it can certainly have a positive impact and become one of the many technologies that helps. And fundamentally, in my mind, it alters the way we think about spectrum. These are important policy decisions which will alter peoples lives down the line. I do admire the US on thistheyve been much more open-minded on this. I think there is a case to be made here as well. I think it is inevitable that there will be an increasing wave of opportunism in terms of spectrum use. Its like what Andy Grove said once: if you have a great piece of technology, you can send lawyers and bureaucrats to delay it. Ultimately the technology goes around it. Can you talk about some of your work in this area? Aside from my thesis on this subject, I even have a follow-on paper that was published. Its all there in my thesisits called SATYA, which was an algorithm, a system that we built with one of my professors at Harvard, where we showed that even on top of this, you can actually raise revenues. We showed how it lowers the barrier for access to spectrum, while also increasing overall revenues. This will be an inevitable part of our futureand thats what my work shows, what are some of these challenges and how do we overcome them. And how it will fundamentally alter our view on how spectrum is used.So, what are some of the challenges facing India?In this country and every country, our issue is about how do you connect more and more people to the Internet. There are a couple of different ways in which it can happen. One, you assume there is a fibre to every home. But we both know thats prohibitively expensive to build and to maintain. Its not easy. Second, everything will be through wireless, such as 4G. I think thatll work to a certain extent, but as we have seen in other countries such as the UK and the US, if you try to wire up large portions of the country where you dont have purchasing power, then the economic argument is not justified. In my mind, Ive always felt there is some other way to connect these people. I think there is room to wire up large parts of the country with some sort of semi-unlicensed spectrum. So, are we talking about the need for a wide-scale policy overhaul in India on this matter?Absolutely. Separately, how do you view Reliance Jios entry and the current price wars that are brewing between telcos?Im a fan of anything where the consumer wins. If I can get 4G everywhere at a reasonable price, Im happy.",2016-12-10,MZp7mAMVUiI5Nm8jZaqvwK,"The founder of Murty Classical Library on his research on White-Fi, or white space network, and the focus on architecture for dynamic spectrum access in wireless networks",01:48,Spectrum in general is underutilized: Rohan Murty
-0.55,"Mumbai: If the much-hyped Unified Payments Interface (UPI) of the National Payments Corp. of India is not working as well as it should, blame the large banks.
				   
				Thats the surmise of the Economic Survey 2017 which studied a huge volume of transactions of the so-called Aadhar-enable payment system and discovered that transactions between customers of different banks failed much more often than those between customers of the same bank. The so-called decline rate (failure rate) was 56% in the case of the former, almost double that of the failure rate in the latter. Aaadhar enabled payment system is a bank led model which allows online interoperable transactions at micro ATMs through the business correspondent of any bank using the Aadhaar authentication.One plausible hypothesis for this differential is that the larger banks are declining transactions involving smaller remitting banks while ensuring that transactions involving themselves are honoured, the survey said. The survey warned that as more entities join the UPI, banks should facilitate interoperability instead of thwarting it. But such problems will need to be addressed, since payments banks, telecommunications companies, and small banks are in the vanguard of financial inclusion. So their access to the UPI platform will be critical for advancing digitalization, especially for the poor, the survey said.The Economic Surveys comment is telling.Digital wallet companies raised concerns about banks blocking transactions to protect their turf. Recently, ICICI Bank blocked transactions on payments app PhonePe, citing security issues and violation of UPI guidelines on inter-operability. State Bank of India also blocked net banking transactions with e-wallet companies, although it allowed customers to top their mobile wallets with debit and credit cards. Principally we have favoured interoperability not just among banks but also among banks and non-banks. The proportion of cash transactions still continue to be high. There is therefore a need to take a long term view for the industry. Anything that comes in the way of being interoperable is not good, said Naveen Surya of the Payments Council of India, a lobby group of digital wallet companies. Ever since the government decision to ban Rs500 and Rs1,000 currency notes on 8 November, it has tried to promote cashless transactions. The biggest beneficiaries of this move have been digital payment firms and wallet operators. According to the latest RBI data, the volume of UPI transactions in January was 3.9 million as against 2 million in December. Value of UPI transactions more than doubled to Rs 15.1 billion during the period Interoperability is an equally important tenet across payment system. This is something that is agreed to by all. We believe that if an entity does not follow the interoperability regime, then we have all our rights to stop that and give them time to become interoperable. If they become inter-operable they will form a part of various collaberations that we have operating with others.

-0.17,"Shares of Bharti Airtel Ltd rose by around 2.5% in early trading on Wednesday on news that the Telecom Commissions new formula for spectrum usage charge will result in lower costs for some telcos. But by the end of the trading session, the shares gave up more than half of those gains, as it became clear that cost savings will be immaterial. 
				   
				Mint reported earlier this week that Bharti Airtels spectrum usage charge is expected to come down to 3.74% of gross revenue, from 4.9% currently. The cost savings would have been meaningful, although the commission also said that aggregate charges would have to match payments made by telcos in fiscal year 2015-16. In other words, there will be no near-term benefits from the move. From a policy perspective, however, the commissions decisions on spectrum usage charges are heartening. The government is known to eke out maximum revenues from the sector. By capping spectrum usage charges at FY16 levels and agreeing to a lower (3%) charge for future spectrum auctions, there appears to be a slight shift in its stance. Of course, this alone isnt enough to move the needle. Investors in the telecom sector will like to see similar forbearance when it comes to pricing of spectrum in the auctions. Earlier this year, the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India recommended an auction of 700 megahertz (MHz) spectrum with a recommended reserve price of $8.5 billion for a 5MHz block. At the time, Kotak Institutional Equities said that bids for 700MHz spectrum would cause irreparable damage to the industry. A company such as Idea Cellular Ltd, for example, would need to pay $4 billion just for its eight leadership circles. This would increase its already high debt levels by over 70%. The government has shown no sign of toning down its expectations. In the budget for 2016-17, it has factored in receipts of Rs.55,000 crore from fresh sale of spectrum. In other words, it expects bids worth more than Rs.2 trillion in the coming auctions in order to receive an upfront payment of Rs.55,000 crore. In the March 2015 auction, telcos had paid around 26.5% of the total value of spectrum as upfront payment. In this backdrop, its clearly premature to read too much into the softening of the governments expectations on spectrum usage charges.",2016-06-09,O2Nd5SwQzirKfm8P9ZSjFO,"It is premature to read too much into the softening of the governments expectations on spectrum usage charges

0.79,"Mumbai: When the Indian government invalidated high-value banknotes on the night of 8 November, taking out 86% of the currency in circulation by value, it was supposed to be a war on unaccounted-for and untaxed wealth, counterfeit notes and terror financing.
				   
				Somewhere along the way, as serpentine queues formed outside bank branches and automated teller machines (ATMs) for days and weeks together, the slogan changed. It became all about promoting a cashless or at least a less-cash culture in an economy where almost 90% of transactions are paid for in cash.The talk turned to technologies such as mobile wallets, crypto-currencies such as Bitcoin, mobile peer-to-peer payments, block chain technology, payment banks and architectures such as the unified payment interface (UPI) and the recently-launched Bharat Interface for Money (BHIM) app.The total value of all transactions done using electronic payment systems in India in December rose to Rs105 trillion from Rs95 trillion in November, according to representative data released by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) on 17 January. They included transactions done through the real time gross settlement (RTGS) system, the national electronic funds transfer (NEFT) system, immediate payment service (IMPS), credit cards, debit cards, UPI, point of sale (PoS) terminals and mobile banking.Indeed, the growing popularity and rapid adoption of digital payment systems, in the face of a shortage of cash and stringent limits on bank withdrawals, may be a silver lining to the demonetisation of Rs500 and Rs1,000 notesan exercise that some critics have slammed as ill-conceived and hastily implemented.To be sure, India has a long way go before it joins the ranks of countries such as Sweden, Finland, Canada, the Netherlands, Belgium, Singapore, France and the UK where more than 85% of the consumer payment transactions are done digitally.But its a start. Consider this. A day after demonetisation, Ola Money, the digital payment solution offered by ride-hailing company Ola, reported an over 1,500% increase in recharges across the 102 cities of its operation. Oxigen Services India Pvt. Ltd, too, claimed to have broken all its previous records in money uploads and transaction count in the week after the demonetisation.Similarly, the National Payments Corporation of Indiathe umbrella organization for all retail payments systems in Indiaclaimed that in just two days (8-9 November), the use of its domestic card schemeRuPayalmost doubled to around 800,000 transactions a day, compared with a daily average of 400,000 transactions earlier (http://bit.ly/2gdu0bW).One97 Communications Ltd-owned digital payments firm Paytm said on 21 November it had seen more than seven million transactions worth Rs120 crore on that day alone. The company claimed that offline, person-to-merchant transactions had grown to contribute over 65% of transactions. Mobile wallet FreeCharge, too, said it had ramped up its acquisition effort and was targeting signing up one million merchants in the coming 12 months.On 16 January, Paytm said it has received a phenomenal response for new service categories such as hospitals, tolls and petrol pumps, and expects to add more categories in the coming months. According to the company, the new categories are generating six million transactions a month and are expected to overtake mobile recharges (in terms of order volumes) by mid-2017. Over the next few months, Paytm will expand to newer categories such as automobile service stations, school and college hostel cafeterias, dairy outlets, apartment maintenance and traffic challans. The company will convert into a payments banks over the next two months, according to a 4 January Press Trust of India report.In a bid to give the country a digital boost, NPCI said its new electronic toll collection (ETC) system would eventually include other vehicle-related payments such as parking fees, servicing and fuel charges (http://bit.ly/2fIv7xf).It was only in September that NPCI launched a pilot project for Bharat Bill Payment System (BBPS) with 26 Bharat Bill Payment Operating Units (BBPOUs). Most banks now offer UPI-enabled apps on Google Play Store. To use a UPI-enabled app, you need an Android smartphone, a bank account and a registered mobile number linked to your bank account (http://bit.ly/2eiNqw1).Digital transactions began booming after e-commerce firms such as Flipkart, Snapdeal, Amazon, Myntra and Jabong began offering attractive discounts to woo customers. Banks accelerated the efforts with their own mobile wallets, mobile banking apps, and pitches of banking on smartwatches and even social networking sites (http://bit.ly/1fucY4s).The launch of Pockets by ICICI Bank Ltd, Lime by Axis Bank Ltd, PayZapp by HDFC Bank Ltd, SBI Buddy by State Bank of India and Ziggit by IDFC Bank Ltd are cases in point.Large telecom services providers such as Bharti Airtel Ltd and Vodafone India Pvt. Ltd, too, have mobile payments solutionsAirtel Money and Vodafone M-Pesa, respectivelytargeted at their own customer base, largely for mobile recharges and remittances. Idea Money from Idea Cellular Ltd, and Jio-Money by Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd are other telco-led payment solutions. Airtel, meanwhile, has also announced the launch of its payments bank.Banking in India is witnessing what Nandan Nilekani calls the WhatsApp moment, threatening to disrupt the banking ecosystem in India as payments move to mobile and lending to algorithms. With the launch of UPI, the country has crossed a significant milestone.Apart from making payments easier, UPI enables micro-credit. This will help the currently underserved small traders and businesses. The visibility into transactions provided by UPI apps enables financial institutions to evaluate the credit worthiness of its users. Instead of assets, credit will be based on transaction flow, and can be issued instantaneously. This will provide more choice for borrowers, especially those who depend on moneylenders and the informal sector for loans, says Venkatesh Hariharan, director of Indian Software Products Industry Round Table (iSPIRT)a think tank.Smartphones and increasing Internet penetration will only help Indias digital cause. Around 90% of all devices will be Internet-enabled by 2017, and the number of Internet users will touch 650 million by 2020 from 300 million in 2015, predicts a 25 July report by Google and Boston Consulting Group (BCG). The report forecasts the size of the digital payments industry in India to touch $500 billion by 2020, contributing 15% to Indias gross domestic product (GDP). It also predicts that the non-cash (including cheques, demand drafts, net-banking, credit/debit cards, mobile wallets and UPI) contribution in the consumer payments segment will double to 40% in the same period.Further, while around 30 billion bills worth $103 billion are generated every year, of which 70% are paid in cash, initiatives such as NPCIs BBPS may give a further impetus to the digitization of bill payments.The number of mobile wallet users is already three times the number of credit cards issued in the country (24 million in 2015-16), according to the Google-BCG report.The smartphone explosion in India is expected to usher in this new era in digital payments over the next few years, according to the Google-BCG report.India currently ranks second in the world with more than one billion mobile subscriptions. Of this, around 240 million consumers use smartphones, and this base is projected to increase to over 520 million by 2020.Smartphone subscriptions in the country will increase fourfold to 810 million by 2021, according to the India edition of the Ericsson Mobility Report released on 7 June.The Google-BCG report also highlights that micro-transactions will form a substantial portion of the industry, with more than 50% of the person-to-merchant transactions expected to be under Rs100. It predicts that the value of remittances and money transfer that will pass through alternative digital payment instruments will double to 30% by 2020. A related BCG study (http://bit.ly/2bc0gLk) in August forecasts that by 2020, about 315 million Indians living in rural areas will be connected to the Internet, compared with 120 million now.Globally, too, the payments landscape is seeing heightened activity across multiple categories, ranging from device manufacturers (Apple Inc., Samsung Electronics Co.), tech firms (Google, eBay Inc., Alibaba Group Holding Ltd), retailers (Starbucks Corp., Wal-Mart Stores Inc.), telecom companies (Vodafone Group Plc., Orange SA) and start-ups (Square Inc., TransferWise Ltd), according to the Google-BCG report.More disruption is expected as the number of fintech start-ups doubled to 1,000 in approximately five years, with funding growing six times to reach $11 billion in 2015.This hockey-stick growth is due to the axis shifting to the customer, who is today served by a variety of competing business models and methods driving its adoption. The explosion in mobile banking is proof enough of how private banks and, later, PSU (public sector undertaking) banks, too, got their act together and worked with start-up fintech firms to rejig their apps, sites and in-house wallets to keep up with customer expectations, rather than trying and do everything by themselves, or waiting for the regulator to issue diktats, says Probir Roy, co-founder and director of digital payments firm Paymate.Hiccups clearly exist.Indians love their cash. Paper currency facilitates making transactions anonymous, helping conceal activities from the government in a way that might help agents avoid laws, regulations and taxes. This is a big difference from most forms of electronic money that, in principle, can be traced by the government, wrote Kenneth Rogoff, Thomas D. Cabot professor of public policy and professor of economics at Harvard University, in an 11 April 2014 paper.This trend is borne out by the fact that retail payments in India, for instance, are still dominated by cash, with a mere 6-7% of transactions conducted electronically. The rest are in cash or cheque.Uber is primarily a cashless service elsewhere in the world, but more than 50% of Uber trips in India are paid for in cash, according to a 10 November blog by Forrester Inc. analyst Ashutosh Sharma.Sharma points out that in India, merchants are forcing the choice of cash payments on customers because electronic payments eat into their marginsjust like everywhere else in the world.Barriers to a cashless world, concurs the World Economic Forum (WEF), include the fact that some merchants still dont want the infrastructure costs and fees associated with electronic payments; some customers still find cash more convenient; access is an issue for individuals without bank accounts; and fraudsters continue to find opportunities in electronic transactions.Consumers who have tried using digital payments but have now shifted to other modes such as cash, card and online banking say the inconvenience of remembering log-in credentials, insufficient acceptance, possibility of a technical or human mistake during a transaction and frequently running out of balance are the top reasons for lapsing, according to the report by Google and BCG. Hence, expanding merchant acceptance is critical to driving mass adoption by consumers.As of 30 September, the number of PoS devices which accept debit and credit cards as modes of payments at merchant outlets was a mere 1.49 million, according to the Reserve Bank of Indias (RBIs) monthly bulletin. Indians had nearly 730 million debit cards and 27 million credit cards at September end, though it isnt clear, however, how many people have more than one card (http://bit.ly/2gc6sFy). Moreover, most Indians use debit cards to withdraw cash from ATMs.According to Roy, a cashless economy has to have appeal and practicality at the most elementary level for consumers and merchants alike, especially given the plethora of overlapping and competing payment options.There are great apps for mobile banking, money transfer, shop and pay, tap and go, etc., and then there are the old faithful viz. net banking, prepaid cards, IMPS and e-wallets, USSD (unstructured supplementary service data) and UPI. The latter (USSD and UPI), yet to quite reach their WhatsApp moment, saddled as it is by the way banks have implemented, and promoting them vis-a-vis other offerings, lack of a people-friendly branding and a common user interface, explains Roy.Roy cites the example of a food court in a mall where you load your food court plastic card, redeem at food stalls on par and cash out the balance when done.Security is another big concern. According to cybersecurity firm Kaspersky Lab, while those who have been transacting online are fairly well-versed with the threats one can face while paying online, its the first-time users or new adaptors that need to be educated on the risks they are exposed to.According to Altaf Halde, managing director (South Asia), Kaspersky Lab, while payments through smartphones are very convenient and frees one of the pressures to hold cash, it calls for precautions. One small slip-up can cause one a huge loss. While companies are bound by law to follow guidelines, fraudsters find their way through many security barricades. The only way to safeguard oneself, in such a scenario, is to be vigilant while paying and to keep the mobile protected with a security plan. With these two simple steps, people can ward off almost all financial theft risks. As the current adjustment period makes way for settlement, we are sure that more people, across economic strata, will find digital payments way more convenient and may make it their preferred mode of payment, says Halde.Being an online security firm, Kasperky Lab recommends that users should get themselves a mobile security plan.Moreover, interoperability issues are causing friction between banks and mobile wallet service providers.On 16 January, for instance, Mint reported that ICICI Bank Ltd had blocked transactions on payments app PhonePe in at least the second such instance of a commercial bank trying to protect its turf against non-bank mobile wallet and payment companies.PhonePe is a UPI app.A day later, PhonePes co-founder and chief executive officer Sameer Nigam took to microblogging site Twitter to allege that ICICI was blocking transactions since Friday (http://bit.ly/2jlYhGX).ICICI Bank cited security concerns as its reason for blocking PhonePe. NPCI initially ordered ICICI Bank to rectify the situation. Later, in a U-turn, it said PhonePe is in violation of UPI norms (http://bit.ly/2iT5Q3F)On 4 January, CNBC-TV18 reported that SBI had blocked net-banking transactions with e-wallet firms, although it allowed customers to top up their mobile wallets with debit and credit cards.At the time, SBI chairman Arundhati Bhattacharya said the service was blocked because of security concerns.Roy insists that an open-access platform allows for interoperability for wallets operators, and diverse choice for customers. This will allow banks to have a wider acceptability of popular third-party prepaid cards and wallets, with minimal loading failure rates.Second, it will enable them to, inter alia, inter-operate seamlessly and with minimal friction across a multi-sided base comprising e.wallets, banks and common merchants (same QR code for instance).Third, banks will have to rework service level agreements with their PoS merchants and card networks to ensure a much higher reliability.In conclusion, says Roy, India is too large a country, diverse in its perceptions, behaviours and idiosyncrasies to have a one-size-fits-all strategy for a post-cash world.",2017-01-27,ODcuu2wmWqGWNUY6wHhmmJ,The rapid adoption of digital payment systems is seen as a potential silver lining to the exercise that caused a widespread cash crunch thats only now beginning to ease,01:27,Indias cash conundrum: how ready is India to go cashless?

				Reliance had in 2014 ordered building of six Very Large Ethane Carriers (VLECs) at Samsung Heavy Industries Pvt. Ltd shipyards in Korea. The vessels are the first to feature new membrane technology from French specialist Gaztransport & Technigaz SA(GTT), considered key to the execution of the project.With a capacity of 87,000 cubic meters, the two vessels are the largest ethane carriers built to date.In a ceremony held in Geoje (South Korea), RIL inaugurated its very first two VLECs, GTT said in a statement.The two vessels, named Ethane Crystal and Ethane Emerald, are the first in a series of six VLECs ordered by RIL in 2014.Japans biggest shipping company Mitsui OSK Lines Pvt. Ltd will manage and operate the ships for RIL.Ethane, a natural gas component, is expected to be produced in large volumes in North America due to the shale gas revolution, which has generated an abundance of liquefied natural gas (LNG) and liquefied petroleum gas (LPG). Ethane is primarily used as a petrochemical feedstock to produce ethylene by steam cracking.RIL plans to ship 1.5 million tonnes a year of ethane from its US shale joint ventures to its chemical complex in Gujarat. The firm has two joint ventures (JVs) in Pennsylvanias Marcellus Shaleone with Chevron Corp., in which it has invested $1.7 billion, and another with Houston-based Carrizo Oil & Gas Inc., in which it has invested $392 million. It has a third JV, in which it invested $1.5 billion, in Texas Eagle Ford Shale group with Dallas-based Pioneer Natural Resources Co.The worlds richest energy billionaire Mukesh Ambani-led RILs business spans petrochemicals, exploration and production, retail and telecommunications. As per the original contract, Samsung was to deliver the ships to be used for ethane transportation, from October 2016 to January 2017. Each ship is priced at $120 million.VLECs are a hybrid of LNG and LPG carriers.

				A global attack on one provider of Domain Name System services, Dyn Inc., took down sites including Twitter, Spotify, Reddit, CNN, Etsy and The New York Times for long stretches of time  from New York to Los Angeles.Kyle York, chief strategy officer of Dyn, said the hackers launched a so-called distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack using tens of millions of malware-infected devices connected to the internet. Speaking during a conference call on Friday afternoon, York said Dyn was actively dealing with a third wave of the attack.By Friday evening, Dyn said it had stopped the hacks. As you can imagine it has been a crazy day, Dyn spokesman Adam Coughlin wrote in an e-mail. At this moment (knock on wood) service has been restored.Security professionals have been anticipating a rise in attacks coming from malware that targets the Internet of Things, a new breed of small gadgets that are connected to the internet. That was after a hacker released software code that powers such malware, called Mirai, several weeks ago.Gillian M. Christensen, a spokeswoman for the Department of Homeland Security, said the agency and the FBI are aware of the incidents and investigating all potential causes.Internet havocDyn first reported site outages relating to the DDoS attack at around 7:10am New York time. The company restored service two hours later but was offline again at around noon, as another attack appeared to be underway, this time affecting the West Coast as well.While DDoS attacks dont steal anything, they create havoc across the internet -- and are on the rise in volume and power.Earlier in the day, Brian Krebs, a well-known journalist covering computer security, wrote that the timing of the attacks corresponded with the release of research conducted by Dyns director of internet analysis. Dyn highlighted potential connections between firms that offer to protect against DDoS attacks, and the hackers who conduct them. Krebss own website faced an extremely large and unusual DDoS attack after he published a story based on the same research, he said.We cant confirm or even speculate on anyones motivation or relation to that research, said Dave Allen, Dyns general counsel.Common warfareWith attacks on the internets Domain Name System, hackers compromise the underlying technology that governs how the web functions, making the hack far more powerful and widespread.The DNS translates website names into the Internet Protocol addresses that computers use to look up and access sites. But it has a design flaw: Sending a routine data request to a DNS server from one computer, the hacker can trick the system into sending a monster file of IP addresses back to the intended target. Multiply that by tens of thousands of computers under the hackers control, and the wall of data that flooded back is enormous. A small server may be capable of handling hundreds of simultaneous requests, but thousands every minute cause overload and ultimately shut down, taking the websites it hosts offline with it.The practice often is employed by groups of hackers. In 2012, a DDoS attack forced offline the websites of Bank of America Corp., JPMorgan Chase & Co., Citigroup Inc., Wells Fargo & Co., U.S. Bancorp and PNC Financial Services Group Inc.A DDoS can be achieved in a number of ways, but commonly involves a distributed network of so-called zombie machines, referred to as botnets. A botnet is formed with computers and other connected devices in homes or offices infected with malicious code which, upon the request of a hacker, can flood a web server with data. One or two machines wouldnt be an issue, but if tens or hundreds of thousands fire such data simultaneously, it can cripple even the most sophisticated web servers.In the case of the Dyn incident, the computers targeted were DNS servers. Without a DNS server, large numbers of websites are inaccessible by users across a country or even the world. In other words, taking away the DNS servers is like taking away all the road signs on a countrys highway system. Single company targetedSo-called authoritative DNS providers like Dyn are notoriously hard to secure. Carl Herberger, vice president for security solutions at Radware, an Israeli-based internet security company, likens authoritative DNS providers to hospitals, which must admit anyone who shows up at the emergency room. Dyn must consider traffic going to a website as initially legitimate. In the event of a DDoS, Dyn must work quickly to sort out the bad traffic from the good, which takes time and resources, and creates outages that ripple across the internet, as was the case Friday.Dave Palmer, director of technology at UK cybersecurity company Darktrace, said the most recent DDoS attacks have been linked to Internet of Things devices, in particular web cams.The joke about the Internet of Things was that you were going to get people hijacking peoples connected fridges to conduct these attacks, but in these recent cases the culprit seems to be webcams, Palmer said. We will probably see, when this is investigated, that it is a botnet of the Internet of Things.To avoid massive outages, companies ramp up their capacity to try to absorb the deluge of traffic and reroute it, often with the help of a major telecommunications carrier or cloud-services provider like Akamai Technologies Inc. and CloudFlare Inc. But the only way to really prevent denial-of-service attacks may be to increase the overall security level of consumers around the world, Palmer said, a task that is getting harder as more and more devices are connected to the Internet.This is exactly what happens when tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands of devices are left unprotected, Palmer said.

0.51,"Reliance Communications Ltd (R-Com) is acquiring Sistema Shyam Teleservices Ltds wireless business for equity worth Rs.2,100 crore. It has also committed to paying Sistemas liabilities to the government, the present value of which is Rs.2,400 crore. 
				   
				These look like extremely high valuations for Sistemas loss-making operations, and the deal will only make sense if R-Com can monetize the spectrum assets through a favourable arrangement with Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd. R-Com has paid three times Sistemas annual revenues of Rs.1,500 crore. This is much higher than Bharti Airtel Ltd and Idea Cellular Ltds enterprise value to sales valuation of around 2.2 times. While these companies have operating profit margins of over 30%, Sistema reported operating losses were well over 30% of its revenues. Even if R-Com extracts all synergies possible and improves Sistemas operating profit to 30%a far crythe valuation still looks unpalatable at 10 times, far higher than 6-7 times EV/Ebitda valuation of incumbents. Ebitda stands for earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. But Sistema holds 800 mega Hertz (MHz) spectrum in eight key circles, which can be extremely valuable for Reliance Jio. It will help in launching its LTE services, including voice over LTE, with much wider coverage, vis-a-vis spectrum in higher frequency bands.Analysts at Kotak Institutional Equities said in a note to clients, We see this transaction as just a precursor to a much larger transaction involving R-Com and R-Jio. We note that there is very little circle overlap between the liberalized 800MHz spectrum holdings of R-Jio and MTS (Sistema). Of the 10 circles in which Reliance Jio has 800MHz spectrum, six are in so-called C-level circles, which are the least lucrative in terms of revenue potential. Sistema holds spectrum in lucrative circles such as Delhi, Gujarat, Tamil Nadu, Karnataka and Kolkata. Based on the discovered prices in this years auction (and using the reserve price in circles where there werent any bids), Sistemas spectrum in these eight circles is worth Rs.7,955 crore. Not all of this will necessarily flow into R-Coms books, even if Reliance Jio agrees to the price. This is because the governments spectrum-trading guidelines includes a clause that states that for any spectrum acquired in the March 2013 auction (such as Sistemas), trading will be permitted only if the price differential vis-a-vis the latest auction price is paid. The spectrum was acquired for Rs.3,639 crore, which means a differential of Rs.4,316 crore will need to be paid before this spectrum can be traded. Sistema has challenged this clause in the courts, and if it wins, R-Com will make it an additional payment of $300 million (approximately Rs.2,000 crore), according to a Sistema spokesman. R-Coms statement states, An appropriate payment/earn-out mechanism has been agreed in relation to disputed spectrum contiguity charges claimed by DoT. On the other hand, if the department of telecoms claim is upheld, Sistema will bear no liability. In either case, R-Com can only hope to recoup these additional costs when it sells the spectrum eventually to Reliance-Jio. All told, much depends on the outcome of this case. More depends on how much Reliance Jio is willing to cough up for spectrum in these eight circles. Doubtless, it will seek to tweak its outgo depending on R-Coms effective cost. R-Com chairman Anil Ambanis comments at the companys annual meeting suggested that a deal with Reliance-Jio is imminent. R-Coms market capitalization has risen by Rs.4,400 crore since then. Its doubtful Reliance-Jio will leave so much on the table, especially considering the fact that its capex has already reached unusually high levels. Investors should tone down their expectations.

0.2,"The price of lead has suddenly surged by about 12% from its low in end-January. If the trend continues, it could be very discomforting for battery manufacturers. Any rise in the price of lead, the key input for making batteries, pulls down operating margins of these companies, unless of course, it is passed on to customers.
				   
				But currently, it seems rather difficult for manufacturers to hike battery prices. The reason is weak demand for automotive batteries in the replacement market, where profit margins are far higher than for the original equipment supplies. Cut-throat competition between two market leaders Exide Industries Ltd and Amara Raja Batteries Ltd would make a price hike difficult. And then, there is the unorganized battery manufacturing segment too that competes in the replacement market.In fact, in its December quarter results media release, market leader Exide Industries had said that there was no significant improvement in demand for the automotive original equipment (OE) and industrial battery, including demand for inverter as well as power, telecom and solar batteries. The last four quarters performance shows that Exide Industries revenue stagnated, whereas Amara Rajas was erratic.Has profitability peaked then for the two listed entities and market leaders? Exide Industries December quarter operating margin at 15.4% was the best in many years. Likewise, Amara Raja delivered a power-packed 232 basis point year-on-year jump in operating margin. But most of this came on the back of plummeting lead prices that hit the abyss in the latter part of calendar year 2015. For instance, Exide Industries raw material cost was 400 basis points lower year-on-year. A basis point is 0.01%.Now, the reversal in lead prices and subdued demand growth in automotive replacement battery sales will weigh on profit margins, albeit with a lag. This could hurt investor sentiment that has been highly optimistic for several quarters. Besides, stocks of both these companies have rallied and valuations, which range between 20 and 25 times one-year forward estimated earnings per share, arent cheap.The only ray of hope is that truck sales have been robust for about two years. A revival of truck battery sales in the replacement market could add to volumes and help offset, at least partially, the rise in raw material costs.",2016-03-17,P5HzBQbnQtCcwWvckC42eJ,"The price of lead has suddenly surged by about 12% from its low in end-January.

0.05,"Mumbai: Running a marathon is a metaphor for Natarajan Chandrasekarans career. 
				   
				Twice over.In Tata Consultancy Services Ltd (TCS), a business he will lead until 21 February, Chandra, as he is popularly known, has spent almost 30 years, his entire working life.He started as a software programmer with TCS in 1987 and rose through the ranks to become one of the youngest chief executive officers (CEOs) in Tata group when he was 46 years old in 2009.Now, as he prepares to take over as chairman of Tata Sons Ltd, Chandrasekaran is in effect getting ready to run another marathon.He is 53 and the retirement age for top Tata executives is 70, giving him a potential 17 years at the helm of the $103-billion group that has businesses ranging from salt to steel and tea to telecom.Running a marathon is also a metaphor for running a business, according to Chandrasekaran.You have to decide on the length of the engagement, develop endurance to handle setbacks and increase speed when the competition demands it, Chandrasekaran said in an interview to Runners World magazine in October 2015 (bit.ly/2iFOCtK).You have to perform with your heart and your mind; you will not get lost on the way if you have a good road map; you will get nowhere without discipline. This is what I always tell my employees in speeches, he said.He will start running his new marathon at a time when Tata group is in the midst of a bruising battle with its former chairman, Cyrus Mistry, who was sacked on 24 October in a boardroom putsch, less than four years after he succeeded family scion Ratan Tata.Also read: Tata vs Mistry: NCLT dismisses contempt of court plea filed by Mistry firmsThe feud between Mistry, who has accused the 149-year old business house of a variety of corporate governance violations, and Tata has reached the National Company Law Tribunal, or NCLT, where a long and messy legal battle is looming.The Mistry family is the largest minority shareholder in Tata Sons, the holding company of the group.We are at an inflection point, Chandrasekaran wrote in an emailed statement after his appointment. I am aware that this role comes with huge responsibilities. It will be my endeavour to help progress the group with the ethos, ethics and values that the Tata group has been built on.A Tata Sons spokesperson said the chairman-designate was not available for interviews immediately.Chandrasekaran, we believe will now inspire the entire Tata group to realize its potential acting as leaders in their respective businesses, always in keeping with our value system and ethics and adhering with the practices of the Tata group which have stood it in good stead, the Tata Sons board said in a statement on 12 January while announcing his elevation. The five-member selection committee chose him unanimously, it added.Also read: Tata Sons new chairman has twin obstaclesa family and a conglomerateChandrasekaran would be no stranger to the value systems and the practices that the board is talking about. The man who would have been a farmer joined the company after completing his Masters degree in computer applications from the Regional Engineering College in Trichy, Tamil Nadu. Over time, he has worked in a variety of positions (chief operating officer, executive assistant to S. Ramadorai, the previous CEO), and places (California and Stockholm). In that sense, he is an insider.He is an outsider because he is the first truly professional chairman of the Tata Sons board who is not related to the Tata family.Nowroji Saklatwala, the third chairman of the group, was the nephew of Jamsetji Tata, the founder of Tata group. Cyrus Mistry is the brother-in-law of Noel Tata, half brother of Ratan Tata.This can be interpreted in two ways: Either the Tatas chose a safe option by choosing an insider, or the group took a step forward to regain its tarnished credibility by choosing a non-family memberand one with a proven track recordto lead the firm.Also read: N. Chandrasekaran begins long road to restoring Tata groups imageIndeed, Chandrasekarans first task will be to restore the reputation of the group and the sheen of brand Tata.A day after his ouster, Mistry (in a letter that subsequently found its way into the public domain) said the Tata group was beset with a host of corporate governance issues.The group was staring at a potential $18-billion write-down, he claimed. It persisted with a loss-making project, the Nano small car, because it was an obsession with Ratan Tata; there was undue interference from some of the trustees of the Tata Trusts, which own two-thirds of Tata Sons; some friends and associates of Ratan Tata benefited from Tata group contractsthey all were a part of Mistrys lists of allegations.Subsequently, the listed companies of the Tata group lost 6.1% (till 16 January) of their market capitalization, and regulators began asking questions.The controversy at Tata group is not his (Chandrasekarans) creation. He just needs to ride it out. I think if he can build a reasonably supportive relationship with Cyrus, it will be good for the image of corporate India, said Ganesh Natarajan, vice-chairman at Zensar Technologies Ltd, who has worked with Chandrasekaran at software industry lobby Nasscom.Restoring the reputation is just a start. The fact remains that the Tata group has several underperformers. The so-called legacy hot spots which were named by MistryTata Power Co. Ltds Mundra plant in western Gujarat, Tata Steel Europe, Indian Hotels Co. Ltd, Tata Teleservices Ltd and Tata Motors Ltd passenger vehiclesall are pressure points.For instance, in the four years to fiscal 2016, Tata Steel has taken an impairment charge of at least Rs24,175 crore, most of it attributed to the European assets that it acquired with the 2007 purchase of Corus Group Plc for £6.7 billion (Rs54,000 crore today).In the past fiscal, losses at Coastal Gujarat Power Ltd (CGPL), which houses the Mundra plant, were Rs1,491.86 crore.Looking at data aggregated between 2011 and 2015 and limit the analysis largely to the legacy hot spots, it will show that the capital employed in those companies has risen from Rs1.32 trillion to Rs1.96 trillion A realistic assessment of the fair value of these businesses could potentially result in a write-down over time of Rs1.18 trillion, Mistry pointed out in his letter.But it wont be easy to rejuvenate these businesses. Selling or exiting them wont be a quick option since it will call into question the business wisdom and legacy of group patriarch Ratan Tata.Look at Tata Steel. Corus is a disaster, said T.V. Mohandas Pai, chairman of Manipal Global Education and former board of director at Infosys Ltd. Cyrus tried to change that by selling assets, but they ousted him as they said it was against Tata values, said Pai.Tata values, he said, cannot be based on destruction of shareholders value.Pai terms Chandrasekaran as a go getter who is great at marketing and building relationships, but he is not sure if he will get the much-needed free hand to run Tata Sons.Once he takes charge at Tata Sons, the key issue wont be whether he will be able to do well, but whether he will have operational freedom, he said.This talk of freedom to operate that Pai is talking about goes to the crux of Mistrys accusations.Mistry, in his 25 October letter, said he had been reduced to the position of a lame duck chairman.He accused Tata Trusts and some of the trusteesRatan Tata and Noshir Soonawala, in particularof excessive interference in the running of listed Tata companies.Documents filed by the Mistry family firmsCyrus Investments Pvt. Ltd and Sterling Investments Pvt. Ltdin NCLT alleged mismanagement of Tata Sons and oppression of minority shareholders, cited some examples and called them shadow directors.These charges have been strongly refuted by Tata and Soonawala in affidavits they filed in reply.Also read: Why Natarajan Chandrasekaran is a safe choice for Ratan TataLeaving this issue aside, Chandrasekaran will anyway have to establish a good working relationship with the principal shareholders of Tata Sons, both in terms of navigating the three-tier structure of the groupTata Trusts, Tata Sons and Tata group operating companiesand in meeting their expectations.Already, the trustees have come out with statements highlighting their concerns.The new leadership at Tata Sons should ensure that the overall profitability and income of the group improves, and the dividend payout by Tata Sons to Tata Trusts not only stabilizes but also increases, said V.R. Mehta, a trustee of the Sir Dorabji Tata Trust, in an interview, a day after Chandrasekarans elevation was announced.The main worry of the trust was the decline in the dividend income of Tata Sons from the operating companies, he said.In a 10 November statement, Tata Sons had pointed out that with the exception of TCS, all 40 other firms (many non-dividend paying) in its portfolio paid dividends that have continuously declined from Rs1,000 crore in 2012-13 to Rs780 crore in 2015-16.It said even the Rs780-crore figure included an interim dividend of Rs100 crore, which would have been normally received in 2016-17. Shriram Subramanian, managing director at InGovern Reearch, a proxy advisory firm, says while Chandrasekarans capabilities are beyond doubt, he needs to ensure that better corporate governance practices prevail in the group, and he is not seen as a yes man to Ratan Tata.Also read: Chandras true test will be shutting down Tatas loss-making businesses: Aswath DamodaranIn TCS at least, Chandrasekaran has proven to be his own man as can be seen from the 2008 reorganization of the software firm into five groups, whose directors began reporting directly to him.But the challenges will be different now, when it comes to dealing with other group CEOs, many of them his peers.To some extent, Chandra will also be constrained by not having the experience of having dealt with huge debt and with bankers, said Subramanian.TCS has been the cash cow of Tata group. It accounts for around 17.5% of the total revenue of the conglomerate. It is the company which spews cash to fund Tata ventures into newer businesses, allowing Tata Sons to act like a private equity investor.Chandrasekarans role so far has been to keep it running smoothly and build on the gains made previously; under him, TCSs market capitalization and revenues grew more than three times. But now, he needs to figure out ways to replicate his success with TCS in unfamiliar businesses.The culture in the IT (information technology) industry is one of youthful exuberance, service orientation, technological innovation and collaborative learningan antithesis to the rough and tough shop-floor realities of old-world industries, wrote Prabal Basu Roy, a Sloan Fellow from the London Business School and a chartered accountant, in a column on 14 January. Therefore, this cultural and skill set mismatch will be a major challengethough charismatic leadership can overcome some of this.But such concerns are brushed aside by Tata insiders.Also read: The many challenges of Natarajan ChandrasekaranIf the group chairman knows everything, it will create over dependence and everyone would look upon him rather than doing it on their own, said K. Santhanakrishnan, non-executive and non-independent director at Tata Global Beverages Ltd. The group needs his soft skills. The hardware already exists in the form of professionally managed boards and professional executive management. His experience in the software industry which has linkages with all the sectors and his wide international exposure and acceptability across, would really help the group.Chandrasekaran takes charge at a time when the group needs a strategic reorientation. With the election of Donald Trump, who has vowed to protect American jobs, as US President and the shift in customers spending patterns from traditional IT services to a digital domain, TCS itself is going to face tough times and may not be able to sustain its dividend track record.At the same time, tough calls have to be made to bring down group debt, which stands at Rs2.25 trillion, and which new businesses to focus on.The reactions I get to my philosophy are heartwarming. No less than a thousand employees responded to my call to run the Mumbai Marathon together, Chandrasekaran said in the Runners World interview.To succeed in his new job and successfully complete the metaphorical marathon he is embarking on, he will need a similar response from the 660,000 employees of Tata group.",2017-01-20,PUT0dMs7Buh2WJTdbafJzM,MintAsia examines the challenges Natarajan Chandrasekaran faces  as he prepares to take the helm at Tata Sons at a time when the group is engaged in an ugly feud with its ousted chairman Cyrus Mistry,01:26,Marathon Man

The merged entity could sell the additional spectrum in almost five circles to Airtel or Jio. We believe that a potential Idea/Vodafone merger could make strategic sense (move to No.1 market share, scale/synergy benefits, and complementary footprint with Vodafone strong in urban areas and Idea strong in rural areas), Bank of America Merrill Lynch said in a note on Monday. The brokerage suggested that the merged entity would realize an increased Ebitda (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) of 9-12% as a result of synergies in operating expenditure arising from the merger.Jios entry has also forced rivals to make huge investments, leading to mounting debts for all operators.With current level of wafer-thin margins, it is uneconomical to invest more in acquiring contiguous territories, spectrum or upgrade into 4G or LTE technology. Hence, consolidation is inevitable, said Singapore-based Sanjay Guglani, chief investment officer at Silverdale Funds.Ideas net debt is expected to cross Rs55,000 crore by the end of March 2017.

Jio has contributed to the acceleration and aligning of India to the rest of the big economies, Colella added.The limited spread of wireline fixed infrastructure in India has led to limited usage of broadband. As the country moves to 4G, there is expected to be massive demand for smartphones.We are anticipating by 2020 we will have at least 800 million smartphones in the market, so the Internet, for Indian people, is mobile. That is a major difference, Colella said.(The other difference is) the industry was not predicting to have Android phones at $40 per unit at the end of 2016, probably expecting it to happen in at least 12 months, if not 18 months further, he added.True Software Scandinavia AB, which makes the Truecaller mobile app to identify incoming calls through a crowd-sourced database, is another Swedish company that has gained from the Jio launch.The number of Truecaller users on the Jio network is already three times that of any other carrier, its co-founder Alan Mamedi said.We see that Reliance Jio right now is three times bigger than other carriers for us, as new users are joining every day. It is not that users from other carriers are droppingthey actually continue to grow. So, the trend we are seeing is that more people get connected for the first time because it is affordable, which is very interesting, Mamedi said.Mamedi added that Reliance Jio will remain a game-changer even after the expiry of free services offer since the tariffs are 10 times cheaper than the competitor.Truecaller, which entered India in 2009, struggled in the initial years as the data market had not developed, and found its feet only after the widespread adoption of 3G and 4G services.Mamedi said as more people use 4G services, it will give tools to smart people to create something magical, driving more start-ups.Home-grown mobile handset manufacturer Lava Mobiles is another company that has gained from the Jio launch. The company hopes widespread 4G adoption will help double its market share to 20% by 2020.In the operator sector, they are doing disruption, but this disruption will increase the operator business also, pushing it to double. Each company is going to gain, Lava Mobiles chairman and managing director Hari Om Rai said.Lava Mobiles is currently investing at least Rs2,600 crore for capacity expansion to produce 18 million devices every month by 2021.4G phones have witnessed a very a high demand in last six weeks. For our industry, it is very valuable. There will be disruption and explosion in the industry. Under-Rs5,000 phones (smartphones) are going to grow like anything and feature phone to smartphone transition is going to happen faster, with even 4G feature phones coming in, Rai said.",2016-11-15,Sbp7OdpxCUhAqrR72ZFj3I,"The roll-out of Reliance Jios 4G services has a cascading effect on equipment providers and handset makers, among others",01:54,"Reliance Jios entry a boost for Ericsson, Truecaller and Lava Mobiles"

				After a series of allegations over issues related to points of interconnection, predatory pricing and Internet usage charge, there seems to be a truce between Airtel and Jio.ALSO READ | Reliance Jio is here to stay: Airtel CEOIn an interview, Airtel chief executive Gopal Vittal said Jios entry strategy is good and bold and that the firm is here to stay. Vittal, however, said Airtel will continue to bank upon its spectrum assets, brand, network expansion and capital expenditure. Edited excerpts:How do you look at your operations in the wake of Jios entry?We still feel there is an opportunity in the rural areas and we are going deeper there to drive penetration. We believe managing price volume trade-off to maximize Arpu (average revenue per user) is very important. Driving penetration of data is a very important piece; we have seen a slowdown in last six months. We have put in a bunch of initiatives in the last three months and we see some early signs of success.ALSO READ | Airtel to combat Reliance Jio on price, bundling and cost front: CEO Gopal VittalThe metric we chase is our revenue market share (RMS) because we believe that RMS is the only metric that determines if customers are giving you a higher share of their wallets. And in the last one year, the highest increase we have seen is an almost 1.5% growth in market share and the incremental revenue that is generated in a year, we got about 50% of that last year.The long answer to your short question is, its not about the next three or six months, it is really about continuing to drive this passionately because we have seen competitors come and go. I mean in the last 10 years, its been a brutally competitive industry. There used to be 13 players and many players were operating at half the pricing of what we are operating at. We have had bumps, ups and downs on the road, it is not that every year has been great. We have had years where we have actually lost market share and then we had to come back. And consequence of losing market share is that you lose everything, revenue and margin, you lose it all. So this is a metric which is very important to us to make sure we are competitive.Why is the slowdown in data happening?I think the barriers to it are many, one is the price of the devicethe difference between a Rs3,000-3,500 phone which is the cheapest device for data and lets say a Rs1,000 device which is a feature phone is still a big deal for many customers. Second is that a lot of customers dont know what to do with the Internet; even if they need it, they dont know how to use it. The other part is that they have a perception that its expensive and there is a perception of value that you need to create. So, its a combination of all of these things. Amongst women, its much lower than men, penetration rate is substantially low even in urban areas, let alone in rural.So, contrary to the perception that Jios entry will boost data consumption, it hasnt really?I think there is a difference between penetration and consumption. Consumption will continue to grow. As pricing comes down, people use a lot. I think in the long term, penetration will grow, there is no question about it. I am just saying that this is an important piece that we should acknowledge, do a bunch of things to actually shape it.  Do you think what Jio is doing is sustainable?I think it is sustainable. Ultimately, its got linked to revenue. To that extent, they have chosen to play in a certain way, which is good and bold. Hopefully, it works for them.But the strategy that they have come out with, has the industry seen similar strategies before?Firstly, you have not seen that. You have seen one of the players who operates in six circles, who operates in voice pricing, which is 50-60% lower, which is Telenor. There again, they have bundles. At certain price points (for voice), speak as much as you want. That we have seen. They also have very simple tariff plans, which has worked for them, but they have come under some pressure in terms of whats happening in the context of the industry. How will you assess the impact of Jio? I would say they are certainly going to stay. You would see consolidation in the market. Even today, you have eight players; and in the next three years, you may see four players. Thats a good thing.From our position, it would come back to whether we have spectrum assets, capex and financial wherewithal to invest in the network and the answer to that is, yes.How do you see the data and voice play turning out in the coming quarters? We have seen erosion in both voice as well as data. Data has been more secular. It has been growing year on year. I think the data tariff erosion is okay as long as we get data-driven revenue growth. What we have seen most recently is revenue growth softening. Part of that is on account of free services because there are people who want to try it for free.On voice, we have seen elasticity. We have seen strong growth on volumes and erosion on tariff for us. Voice revenue growth has been pretty good. Last quarter we had 9-10% growth, which is reasonably good. We will see some softening of this growth because of free services being offered and some point when they get priced in, we will come back and look at how do we respond to that.Which of the twodata or voicewill have more growth?In India, the average use of minutes is 415 or 420. It is among the highest in the world. The only market which is higher is the US because you have voice free in all their plans. But the pricing starts $40-$50. So, there it is 50% higher. There is a finite limit to how much I want to speak to the other person. That will see more secular growth. On data, sky is the limit because you can do everything through the Internet. Do you see a point where voice can be made completely free like you said about the US?I think there will be a duality to the market. Voice will be free when someone is paying for the data. If everything is free, then we are not having this conversation. But if you are making something free, then you have to charge something else. So, the key question that comes out is, how much Arpu do you get? I think there will be a set of customers who will demand that through bundles. So, that will happen. Will that happen all across the market? I dont think so. I think there will still be some amount of duality in the market.So, you do not see a tipping point for making voice free?Even today, we are doing it. The 1599 price has come down to 999. At 999, voice is free with a bundle of data. But, people are paying for the package. Whether I am paying for voice or data, it does not really matter. I am paying for the aggregate. If that numbers comes down then the question is for competing whats the price you want to compete at? Thats a stroke of the pen decision. This market is complex and nuanced enough that you cant do a call and odd approach. It is not this or that. You have to play together because the scale that we have, the number of customers we serve, we will have to play them together. This is true for the industry: 20% of customers give you 50-60% of your revenue. This is true for all categories. Does that mean that 40-50% of the revenue is not important? No. It is absolutely important but we will have to find the right cost to serve them. So, thats where the and comes in. You have to do both. For a new entrant, it is easier because you will say I will only operate like this. In the context of planned investments by Jio and Vodafone, how do you look to fund your expansion? We generate close to Rs. 15,000-16,000  crore of cash on an annual basis. Our net debt to EBITDA is 2.2, which is very comfortable and very competitive with the best run telcos around the world. So whether you look at it from the spectrum perspective, or rolling out capex a year and half in advance, or brand in terms of who owns 4G today, or best broadband experience or whether its our customer base of 260 million, in all respects we are in a solid position. But from a financial position, the fact is that this industry is in deep debt and the return on capital of the entire industry is less than 1%, which is really low. Even for us as a leading player, we earn just 8% which is no different than a fixed deposit. So that is the function of the humongous cost of spectrum that we have purchased and some of that was a function of what happened in 2014, where we did the renewals. Where we were actually forced to buy, there was not enough spectrum and so if we didnt buy we would be forced out of business and we may have overpaid because of the design of that auction. What is your road map on cutting down the debt? We have just announced a process with a proposed significant stake sale of Infratel. A committee of directors has been appointed, they will look into it, study it and look at all the options on the table for the board. Beyond that I cannot comment right now.",2016-11-02,UBHj5LZi5HeOpQepV8xx4I,"Airtel CEO Gopal Vittal in an interview says the telecom firm will continue to bank upon its spectrum assets, brand, network expansion, capex",01:31,"Airtel planning rural expansion, in wake of Jio entry: CEO Gopal Vittal"
0.43,"Bengaluru: The squabble between rival factions owing allegiance to Cyrus Mistry and Ratan Tata at the Tata group could mask the potentially poor performance of individual companies. Tata Consultancy Services Ltd (TCS) could be one beneficiary.
				   
				According to BNP Paribas, TCS will report a 6% increase in dollar revenue in the current financial year, down from last years 7%. Even this projection looks a tad generous, and, according to Mint calculations, TCS runs the risk of less than 5.6% growth.Put simply, TCS, for the first time since it clocked 5.4% growth in 2009-10, could add less than $1 billion in incremental revenue this year. And that could ring alarm bells at TCS, which ended with $16.5 billion in revenue in the financial year to March last year.TCS will report its fiscal third quarter earnings on Thursday.Accenture Plc., a firm about twice as large as TCS, recorded 6% growth in the year ended August (Accenture follows a September-August financial year). Nasdaq-listed Cognizant Technology Solution Corp., which was about half of TCSs size of $6 billion in 2009when Natarajan Chandrasekaran became the CEO of TCSwill still manage 9% growth to end the year with at least $13.5 billion in revenue (Cognizant follows the calendar year as financial year).At the heart of TCSs underperformance, which started manifesting in July 2014, is its inability to build a stronger consulting practice and the managements reluctance to buy small firms for technologies like design consulting and data analytics and automation platform providers. TCS also faces some client-specific challenges, all of which have led to low growth. Still, over the last two years, this has not stopped TCS management from claiming the company is making itself future-ready. The biggest concern for stakeholders is if TCS will continue to chug along in 2017-18 and disappoint with depressing growth numbers. For now, the signals are not bright. With this as the backdrop, Mint puts the spotlight on five things to watch in TCSs third quarter earnings on 12 January:1. Revenue growth and management commentary on the demand outlookBNP Paribas expects TCSs dollar revenue to inch up 0.3% to $4.39 billion in the October-December period on a sequential basis. Most brokerages do not expect any significant uptick in growth in the current quarter, either. Nonetheless, management commentary on demand for companys services from clients, especially in Europe and US, will be crucial.2. Pressure on profitability Since January last year, TCSs operating margins have been under pressure. Its 26.1% Ebit (earnings before interest and tax) margin at the end of March quarter was 54 basis points less than margins at the end of October-December period of 2014. The companys margins further contracted to 25.1% at the end of June quarter, and improved to 26% at the end of July-September period. Now, as commoditized deals come under further pricing pressure, traditional levers like going slow on hiring will not be enough to offset the gradual decline in profitability. For this reason, most analysts are doubtful if TCS will be able to operate in the managements stated guidance of 26-28%.3. Performance in the banking, financial services, and insurance (BFSI) and retail sectorsAccentures performance in the September-November period and management commentary suggests some weakness in business from clients in the BFSI sector. This spells trouble for a company like TCS, which generates more than 40% of its business from BFSI. Retail segment too has seen a decline, and for this reason, management commentary on BFSI and retail, which together bring about 54% of its total revenue, will be eyed.4. Impact of US bill seeking to increase pay to employees with H1B visasEarlier this month, a legislation demanding that outsourcing firms pay at least $100,000 a year to employees who work in the US was introduced in the Congress. Analysts and industry executive believe it could take up to a year before the US makes this a law. Washingtons demand that companies like TCS pay a minimum wage of $100,000 to employees with H1B visas could hurt profitability by 300-500 basis points, according to a 9 January note by JPMorgan Chase and Co. analyst Viju George. Management commentary on this will be watched.5. Weak sectors and geographiesTCS does not expect growth to rebound in Japan. The company claims to have arrested any loss of business from its UK-based insurance platform Diligenta. Growth from telecoms segment continue to be wobbly. Together, underperformance by the three units eroded about 2% growth from the companys 11.9% growth on constant currency basis in 2015-16.

0.98,"One of the authors of this article built a speech recognition engine in the early 1990s. It was built on a special purpose digital signal processor, in a lab that was especially dedicated to this project. The engine required two days of training, could recognize a single voice and had a vocabulary of close to 50 words. It was close to state-of-the-art at that time. 
Cut to the present. All smartphones today have the ability to recognize speech. No special hardware is needed. Training needs are minimalthe technology works straight out of the box and can be trained to recognize anybodys voice. And the vocabulary is infinite. The phenomenon that enabled this rapid change is the advancement in processing power, storage and communication. Computing speed is doubling every year, as per Moores law, which predicted an exponential growth in the number of transistors in integrated circuits within processors. Similar stories of transformation can be told about storage and communication. Todays technology road maps have gone beyond the classical Moores law with the advent of distributed computing, rapid development of smart devices packed with sensors and the Internet of things.While we have seen a lot of technology transformations over the last 20 years, what is even more fascinating is the expectation that the next two decades will see technology innovations being rolled out at a faster pace than ever before. Technological change will continue to be exponential. Noted inventor and futurist Ray Kurzweil argues that there is even an exponential growth in the rate of exponential growth! What this means is that in the 21st century, we wont see a 100 years of technological progress. We will see 20,000 years of progress at todays rate.FIVE BIG TECHNOLOGY THEMES FOR THE FUTUREWhile there are many technological advancements taking place all around us, we think five big themes will play a very important role in defining the next 20 years.Gene is the new Byte: In the grand scheme of things, we are all very similar. In fact, 99.9% of our genes are identical. Its the last 0.1% that makes all the difference! In April 2003, the human genome was completely mapped for the first time. The rate of reduction in the cost to sequence a persons genome has outpaced even Moores law, from $10 million in 2008 to just $1,000 today. Going forward, this cost is likely to continue dropping and in the near future, we would be able get our complete genome mapped and stored in USB drives or on the cloud for a mere $100. This will open the doors to fantastic possibilities for preventive healthcare and personalized medical treatment. Genome mapping has large implications for agriculture as well, with possibilities like the development of more productive and disease resistant crops, or the creation of diet plans tailored to suit our respective heredities!Disruptions in energy: The end of energy as we know is near. Advancements in technology have reduced the cost of solar energy to 45 cents a watt from $100 a watt in 1970. Interestingly, during this period, other forms of energy have seen a 16-fold increase in price. The average cost of solar panels fell by 75% between 2009 and 2014, and is expected to decline by another 25% by 2018. Solar power tariffs are expected to reach grid parity in India in 2018, and then go below that level. Battery technology is advancing rapidly to help store this energy. Polymer and hybrid-flow battery technology being developed currently will increase energy density, increasing the storage capacity of a given physical space. It is likely that in the near future, many of us will be able to generate, store and use clean solar energy right off our rooftops, at a cost cheaper than buying electricity from the grid. With smart micro-grids, one will even be able to sell excess energy back, creating a truly distributed energy network.Advancements in material science: In Star Trek, the science fiction television show, the crew on-board starships used food replicators to synthesize any meal they wanted while travelling through space. This surreal concept is now inching towards reality. 3D printers have come a long way since the 1980s, and are soon going to be affordable enough for educational and residential usage. Nanomaterials with unique optical, electronic and mechanical properties are driving the next generation of consumer electronics, filtration systems and biomedical treatment. Similarly, advances in biodegradable plastics augur well for environmentally friendly packaging in the future. Ubiquitous digital connectivity: Ubiquitous digital connectivity has been elusive so far although it has been widely talked about by policymakers and technologists. But it is inevitable. Digital access will become more and more affordable as prices reduce. Consumers will increasingly bracket digital connectivity among needs as basic as roti, kapda and makaan (bread, clothes and home), and will allocate a larger share of wallet for it. Digital governance platforms will help governments significantly improve the distribution of subsidy programmes targeted at people with limited means and lastly, corporates that stand to benefit heavily from a burgeoning consumer class may make the economic trade-offs differently. AI and robotics revolution: Artificial intelligence (AI) is already a reality today with Google Search, Siri and IBM Watson being some examples. Todays AI tools excel at complex analytics. In 2016, AI mastered Go, widely considered the most difficult strategy game. However, it struggles with cognitive tasks that a two-year-old can dofor example, knowing the difference between the pictures of a cat and a dog. Genetic algorithms being developed today will strengthen AIs cognitive reasoning capabilities. Limitations on raw computational power will soon be overcome, powering AI tools to do what human brains can. Meanwhile, rapid advances in robotics, such as the development of bio-hybrid robots built using living tissue, are starting to take shape. We are on the cusp of an explosion in AI and robotics, which could make androids a reality in the near future.The interplay between these technology megatrends has the potential to significantly change the world as we know it today. Imagine solar energy-powered 3D printers being airlifted to disaster zones to provide food to people trapped there. Or, a mother in Salem, Tamil Nadu, getting her sons genome mapped, and later getting on a video conference with a New York-based doctor to seek allergy treatment options.Fundamental paradigm shifts driven by accelerating technologyChange in technology fundamentally shifts the production possibility frontier. Every time we hit the law of diminishing returns, newer technology provides a breakthrough. In addition to fundamental shifts in the cost curvewhich are a giventechnology expands the gamut of the possible by significantly altering core trade-offs. Let us look at three conventional business and economic trade-offs, which are getting busted:Two-way real-time interactions versus one-way outreach: In the past, businesses could either focus on rich information tailored to a niche market or reach out to a larger market that sacrificed richness for the additional reach. However, today, two-way, real-time communication with rich and relevant content has become a reality. Digital technology enables access to global platforms for buying and selling, marketing and financing from anywhere. Advanced analytics, combined with mobile technology, is allowing companies to target each consumer individually, across their entire client base. For example, if it is raining, your regular coffee shop can tempt you to brave the weather and visit it by offering you a promotional scheme on your favourite drink, through an app on your smartphone.Supply and demand mismatch: With the shift towards elimination of bespoke hardware, and value migrating to software, it is possible today to match supply with demand almost perfectly. Increased access and connectivity via technology is driving a revolution in the sharing economy as well. Sharing is not new to us. The barter system has been in place for centuries, long before money was invented. Today, we are not only sharing digital information, we are also sharing physical things like homes and vehicles with each other, using digital market places.Scale versus cost: Technology is not only rapidly reducing servicing costs, it is also increasingly enabling businesses to move to an opex spend model, from the erstwhile capex heavy approach. This is helping expand firms reach to new consumers at a faster rate than ever before. For example, consumers with very low deposits can be served economically in an opex spend model, telecom base stations no longer need minimum efficient scale, retail distribution can be customized economically at a micro-market level, and 3D printing can significantly change manufacturing scale. SPECIFIC IMPLICATIONS OF ACCELERATING TECHNOLOGY FOR INDIARadical innovation with next-generation technology architecture:The Internet has served as the main platform for disruption across industries. Its architecture is decentralized, modular and stacked. Lower down the stack, the focus is on scale and efficient utilization, for example, server capacity. Higher up the stack, however, the focus is on content related to user needs and innovation. This stack-based architecture eliminates the trade-off between efficiency and innovation, as higher-layer innovators can rent scale from lower-level platform providers to conduct experiments at lower costs. This is already a reality in our lives. Case in point, Uber, which uses a stacked architecture comprising GPS, Google Maps, electronic payments and connected smartphonesnone of which it ownsto offer a disruptive and consumer-friendly transportation solution.In India, we are witnessing the rising usage of a similar stacked architecture, called the India Stack, in the financial services sector. Jan Dhan Yojana, Aadhaar and mobile phones have created a fundamental layer of customer identification and access, on which multiple digital transactions can be built. This has the potential to solve our financial inclusion problem by eliminating the classical roadblocks of paper-based identity proofs, interaction with a physical bank and the availability of hard cash. The entire stack is an open resource, which means anyone can access and leverage it. A similar open stack architecture is being used by the Goods and Services Tax Network (GSTN) to provide a platform for tax data management and reporting. The platform will provide the plumbing to bring together all GSTN stakeholders including taxpayers, banks, and central and state governments to completely transform Indias tax landscape.This is paradigm shift in technology architecture where innovation happens at the bottom of the stack and is available as a public good at a very low cost to everybody. The implications of this shift are quite profound and if deployed well can be used to address some of our very core socio-economic challenges.Ability to address Indias chronic challenges: Healthcare is one of the most complex challenges of our time, with the infrastructure and capital required to fix the problems and reduce the inequity in healthcare access being insufficient so far. Despite making progress over the last decade, India accounts for a disproportionate percentage of global incidences of disease. We have seven doctors for every 10,000 people, which is only half the average global doctor-patient ratio. Large-scale change is never easy, but technology holds extraordinary promise in helping address our healthcare challenges.By leveraging the technology stack already in placewide connectivity through mobile phones and high-speed data networks, Aadhaar, digitization of health recordswe can significantly improve every element of our health system, from education for prevention, to treatment and management. Big Data and analytics can fundamentally alter healthcare delivery and transform our public health and medical research initiatives through the establishment of national registries. India can become data-rich very rapidly. And a nationwide, connected, many-to-many health information highway with common data standards and interoperability features can just be what the doctor ordered! A similar approach can also be deployed in critical areas such as education and skilling, and it can fundamentally transform how India teaches and learns.Enabling organizations to be trailblazers: Historically, Indian firms have found it hard to address the challenges of low average purchasing power, lack of minimum efficient scale and widespread socio-economic inequity. With the acceleration of technology, these challenges get decimated. Acceleration in technology, coupled with relatively lower legacy investments, gives Indian firms the opportunity to leapfrog their peers to become global trailblazers. Technology makes investments modular, reducing capital outlays and experimentation costs, while increasing speed and agility, which are critical advantages in todays dynamic macroeconomic environment. There is every reason to believe that the next Alibaba, Amazon, Google, Tesla or Uber can emerge out of India.GOING FORWARD, WE NEED TO ADDRESS THREE KEY AREAS TO UNLOCK THIS TECHNOLOGY REVOLUTION1. How do we ensure sufficient investment in infrastructure at the lower level of the stack?Private returns on infrastructure investments are often substantially lower than the underlying social benefits generated. While benefits accrue to the economy at large through positive externalities, this does not assure returns for the infrastructure investor. Also, when infrastructure investment requires an entirely new generation of expensive technology, such as fibre, 4G or 5G, it can compound market failure. The government, through policy formulation, has a key role to play in encouraging sufficient investment in infrastructure.2. What changes should be make in our education system to equip our youth for the technology revolution?There is a need to rethink technology and vocational skills being imparted at higher education institutions. Future jobs will be very different from those in the market today. In addition to solving the existing challenges our education system faces, we need to ensure that it equips our youth with the necessary multidisciplinary skills to meet the needs of tomorrow. 3. How do we drive collaboration across stakeholders to unlock the full potential of technology-enabled transformation?The government, large corporates, start-ups and NGOs have different strengths and capabilities. There is a need to draw upon the expertise of all these stakeholders, and marrying together their complementary skills. We need the right policies and construct for public-social-private partnerships to make this happen.In summary, technological change is accelerating at an unprecedented pace and will change the world as we know it. If we get our act right as a nation over the next decade, technology can help us take India back 1,000 yearswhen we were the most advanced and thriving economy in the world.Neeraj Aggarwal is managing director, and Rohit Ramesh is partner and director at BCG India.",2016-10-19,UoAUwuuIFV498ndi95U3PI,"If we get our act right, technology can help us take India back 1,000 yearswhen we were the most advanced and thriving economy in the world",04:59,Accelarating technology: Indias opportunity to leapfrog
0.09,"Tech Mahindra Ltds shares have risen by about 3% since it announced results last week. It was a rare instance of an Indian IT company reporting a positive earnings surprise. Revenue grew by 1.5% in dollar terms, after adjusting for incremental revenues from acquisitions, according to Nomura Research. This was ahead of the 0.8% analysts were expecting, on an average. 
				   
				For some, such as analysts at Kotak Institutional Equities, the beat on the revenue front was far higher. They had estimated organic revenue growth of just 0.3%. Much of the surprise came from the mainstay telecom business, which grew 2.3% sequentially, after three successive quarters of either flat or negative growth. While the revival in the telecom vertical is heartening, investors seem to be waiting to see if the improvement will sustain. After all, Tech Mahindras valuations continue to languish at less than 12 times estimated earnings for fiscal year 2016-17, and are at a huge discount to other large IT companies. Nomuras analysts point out in a note to clients, Our key concern is why Tech Mahindra is seeing a revival in telecom so late versus Tier-1 IT, for which telecom and media is the fastest-growing vertical at 15% y-y growth in constant currency terms in 2Q versus -3% y-y at Tech Mahindra and is it a case of: 1) Tech Mahindra losing share or 2) client specific or concentration issues or 3) the portfolio having a lower skew towards transformational work.Even so, the companys overall performance in the September quarter should reassure investors. For instance, its top five clients grew for the second straight quarter after six quarters of sluggishness. Besides, deal wins were fairly strong. Margins fell by 50 basis points, although this was on expected lines because of the full quarter impact of acquisitions and a one-off restructuring cost.  A basis point is 0.01%.While all this is good and the stocks cheap valuations are compelling, that alone may not entice investors. If the improvement in performance continues in the December quarter, some investors may bite.",2016-11-03,UtbM0mAb9hgaOKLRiLUYBI,"While the revival in Tech Mahindras telecom vertical is heartening, investors seem to be waiting to see if the improvement will sustain",07:36,Investors stay unconvinced about Tech Mahindras recovery
-0.06,"Delhi and Mumbai are such important markets for Indias top telcos that they have allocated over a third of all their investments in spectrum on these two markets. Not so for Idea Cellular Ltd. Less than 11% of its total outlay for spectrum purchases since 2010 has gone to these markets. 
				   
				And these arent the only markets the company has remained underinvested in after the latest spectrum auction. Analysts at Kotak Institutional Equities wrote in a note to clients that while Idea Cellulars pan-India ambitions remain, it still has a weak mobile broadband footprint in five large marketsDelhi, Mumbai, Kolkata, Karnataka and Tamil Nadu. The company has only a single 3G or 4G carrier in these markets, compared to multiple FDD and TDD carriers acquired by its larger competitors. Lets face itIdea doesnt have a parent that can write a $7 billion cheque. Building strong capacity in these markets is an expensive affair; Idea has to use its resources judiciously and direct them to markets where it has a high share, says an analyst at a domestic institutional brokerage firm. To be sure, Idea Cellulars investments in the remaining 17 circles are even higher than those of Bharti Airtel Ltd and Vodafone India Ltd. In the above-mentioned five markets, Idea Cellular has a relatively low market share, which means that its customers in these markets generate low Arpu (average revenue per user) and are unlikely to use 4G services anytime soon. As such, the firms strategy in these markets appears to be to compete largely in the low-end of the market, with some broadband capacity to cater to those who want to upgrade. Bharti Airtel, Vodafone India and Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd have acquired significant capacity in these markets, which will result in faster connectivity as well as the ability to handle large volumes of data. High Arpu customers will naturally gravitate to one of these companies. A moot question from Idea Cellulars perspective is if there is a business case at all to continue investing in these markets. Operating in the low-end of the market is a low-margin business, which will get further compressed with the ongoing fall in tariffs after Reliance Jios launch. That Idea sees the possibility of building a business case in these circles at some point is a bold assumption, but gritty bold moves are not new to the company, Kotaks analysts say in their note. Vodafone India , despite the $7 billion cheque from its parent company, decided to stay without either 3G or 4G capacity in five marketsAndhra Pradesh, Bihar, Madhya Pradesh, Himachal Pradesh, and Jammu and Kashmir. These markets account for 19% of the industrys revenues, and about 9.5% of  the companys revenue. So, while both companies have a pan-India presence as far as voice services go, their mobile broadband footprint is either weak or absent in some markets. The rumoured merger between the two companies can fill these gaps; although, needless to say, the exercise will be far from straightforward.",2016-10-12,VwoO7urRII2GJC1OVrFUJM,"While both Vodafone and Idea have a pan-India presence as far as voice services go, their mobile broadband footprint is either weak or absent in some markets",00:17,Behind Vodafone and Ideas low-key investments in some key markets
0.1,"Mumbai: The board of Tata Sons Ltd on Monday replaced Cyrus P. Mistry as chairman, less than four years after he took the helm, and named his predecessor Ratan Tata interim chairman for four months.
				   
				The board of the group holding company did not specify a reason for the abrupt move, which was announced after markets closed.Tata Sons in its collective wisdom and on the recommendations of the principal shareholders decided that it may be appropriate to consider a change for the long-term interest of Tata Sons and Tata group, a spokesperson said. A selection committee comprising Ratan Tata, Venu Srinivasan, Amit Chandra, Ronen Sen and Kumar Bhattacharyya was given the mandate of finding a replacement for Mistry, 48, who became chairman of the $103 billion conglomerate in December 2012, at the end of Tatas over two-decade tenure at the top. The board was given four months to complete the task. In the interim, the board has requested me to perform the role of chairman and I have agreed to do so in the interest of and reassurance to the Tata group, Ratan Tata, 78, said in a statement addressed to colleagues.ALSO READ | Uneasy lies the Tata crownThe development, which portends at least short-term turmoil, comes at a time when the conglomerate, whose business interests range from tea to telecom and salt to software services, has been trying to recast or dispose of the key UK steel business, which it acquired in a $12.9 billion purchase of Corus Group Plc. in 2007 under Ratan Tata.This is quite an unusual situation, unexpected from a group like Tata which stands for its values. This means there could possibly have been some governance issue or some major disagreement with either the style of functioning or decision that Mistry may have taken, said Kavil Ramachandran, professor and executive director at the Thomas Schmidheiny Centre for Family Enterprise at the Indian School of Business.According to a person aware of the development, the Shapoorji Pallonji Group, of which Mistry is a scion and which is estimated to hold an 18% stake in Tata Sons, is protesting the move, paving the ground for what could be a messy battle. About two-thirds of Tata Sons is held by philanthropic trusts such as the Sir Dorabji Tata Trust and the Sir Ratan Tata Trust. Mistry will continue as a Tata Sons director, the spokesperson cited earlier said. However, the group executive council (GEC), a brainchild of Mistrys, has been disbanded, said a person aware of the development. The GEC page has been pulled down from Tata Sons website as has Mistrys September interview to the in-house magazine in which he stated his views on some of the underperforming companies in the group. Our individual companies need to earn the right to grow, he said in the interview.The boardroom putsch has been some time in the making, according to a person close to Mistry, who asked not to be identified. Differences have surfaced over how Mistry has been dealing with the significant challenges facing the group.Several of Mistrys operational decisions were challenged by Ratan Tata, according to this person. Still, it is the prerogative of the largest shareholder to do this, the person said a few weeks ago. Mint couldnt ascertain if there was an immediate trigger for this ouster.Primarily, it was a lack of communication between the shareholder and the management. A lot of decision-making was done unilaterally by Tata Sons and was not approved by Tata Trusts, said another person briefed about the matter.Among the six chairmen Tata Sons has had so far in its history, Mistrys is the shortest tenure at just short of four years.ALSO READ | Ratan Tata says intolerance a curse we are seeing of lateSince taking over, Mistry has repeatedly talked about continuing to seize business opportunities, especially in emerging technologies.

-0.09,"Mumbai: The proposal to create Indias largest private sector insurance company has run into hurdle as the Insurance Regulator and Development Authority of India (IRDAI) has opposed the merger of Max Financial Services Ltd and HDFC Standard Life Insurance Company Ltd. (HDFC Life), as per a disclosure made by Max on BSE on Saturday morning.

IRDAI has expressed reservations to accept the scheme of amalgamation in its current form, said Max on BSE. The boards of HDFC Life and Max in August had signed a three way merger, which would create Indias largest private-sector insurer with total assets more than Rs1.1 trillion and lead to the eventual listing of HDFC Life on stock exchanges.Post the merger Housing Development Finance Corp.

Basically, Irdai wants to ensure that the merger is happening between two life insurance companies only , I.e HDFC Life and MAX Life. Since it is a three step merger process and Max Financial Services, which is an NBFC, is also involved in the scheme, Irda wants to ensure that at no stage any amalgamation is happening between Max Financial and any insurance company. So we have to clarify and disclose to Irdai that the non-insurance businesses , such as the telecom business, of MAX Financial Services will be first demerged into Max India and then only the life insurance business of Max Life will be effectively transferred completely to Max Financial Services and subsequently it will be merged with HDFC Life which will result in the automatic listing of the merged entity said a person involved in the merger process on condition of anonymity. Irda had sought the views and recommendation of solicitor general of India a week back and the latest step by Irda has been taken accordingly it seems. The bankers and the lawyers involved in the deal will make a representation to Irda on Tuesday and subsequently the clarifications and the required disclosures will be made. The issue raised by Irda is just a basic technical disclosure requirement for more clarity on the deal to the regulators and the public. This will not come in the way of the merger.

0.64,"Oil companies are likely to report a decent set of numbers for the December quarter. Singapore gross refining margin (GRM), though lower on a year-on-year basis, has improved sequentially (see chart). Nevertheless, a better refining environment is expected to reflect in the December quarter numbers of Indian refining companies. GRM is a measure of the difference between the per barrel price of crude oil and the value of products distilled from it.
				   
				State-run oil marketing companies (OMCs)Bharat Petroleum Corp. Ltd, Hindustan Petroleum Corp. Ltd and Indian Oil Corp. Ltdare expected to report a good quarter thanks to a recovery in GRMs and inventory gains. While we assume inventory gains (GRM $1-2 a barrel, marketing segment $1-1.5 a barrel), we think OMCs could surprise, pointed out Nomura Financial Advisory and Securities (India) Pvt. Ltd. OMC stocks have outperformed the BSE Sensex so far this fiscal year. Currently, they trade in the range of about 9-12 times estimated earnings for FY17.For Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL), improvement in refining margins is expected to be set off to an extent against muted performance from its petrochemicals business. Analysts from Jefferies India Pvt. Ltd expect RILs earnings to be largely flat versus the September quarter. That is because, according to Jefferies, the companys GRM is likely to improve by a more modest $0.7 a barrel to $10.8 a barrel in the December quarter due to a five-week maintenance shutdown at one of its FCC (fluid catalytic cracking) units and sharper improvement in gasoline and fuel oil cracks relative to middle distillate cracks. Middle distillate products account for a relatively higher share of RILs product slate.Secondly, the companys blended petrochemical margin has been slightly lower last quarter. Further, the impact of currency demonetization needs to be watched on the petrochemicals segment. Management commentary on the telecom business and updates on downstream projects will be crucial for the RIL stock, which has underperformed the benchmark Sensex so far this fiscal year.Meanwhile, earnings of upstream oil companiesOil and Natural Gas Corp. Ltd and Oil India Ltdare expected to benefit from the strength in crude oil prices. On the flip side, some of those gains are likely to be offset by the 18% cut in domestic gas price. Shares of both companies have fared well this year but the outlook seems tough.

0.52,"Mumbai: Cyrus Mistry, who was part of the panel tasked to find a successor to Ratan Tata for heading the over $100 billion Tata Group, had himself become a surprise selection only to see his tenure cut short abruptly on Monday within four yearsthe shortest at the conglomerate. 
				   
				The 78-year-old Tata is now part of the selection panel that has been asked to search the next chairman of Tata Sons Ltd, the groups main holding company, within next four months and he would also serve as interim chairman in this period.Also Read: Cyrus Mistry ousted as Tata Sons chairman, Ratan Tata steps inA low-profile man to the extent of being reclusive, Mistry, 48, was a surprise choice to succeed Tata, who retired on 29 December, 2012 as chairman of the one of the countrys oldest business empires. The only second non-Tata to take charge of the group after Nowroji Saklatvala in 1932, Mistry by virtue of his age came in with a lot of promise, specially of continuity when he became chairman of Tata Sonsthe promoter of the major operating Tata companies at the age of 44. However, in nearly four years since he took over the reins of the salt-to-software conglomerate, Mistry had to face many challenges in both domestic and global markets as many of the group companies faced headwinds. He undertook a strategy of divesting assets in contrast to what his successor did. Significant among them is the groups steel business, specially Tata Steel Europe. Earlier this year, the company had completed selling of the European long products business in the UK as well as a mill in France to Greybull Capital. It had also announced plans to sell its UK operations after years of losses, although the company is yet to finalize the sale. In July, Tata groups hospitality firm Indian Hotels Company Ltd (IHCL), which runs Taj Group of hotels, completed sale of Taj Boston hotel for $125 million (about Rs839 crore). The hospitality firm had also sold off 12.7 lakh shares of Belmond (earlier known as Orient Express, which the Tata Group tried unsuccessfully to acquire in Ratan Tatas time) for a consideration of $11.96 million. IHCL had also sold BLUE Sydney, a Taj Hotel, to Australia Hotels & Properties Ltd for AU$ 32 million (nearly Rs179 crore) in 2014. The Tata group is also engaged in a legal battle with Japans Docomo over the split of their telecom joint venture Tata Docomo. Contrary to these developments, Tata led the group into some notable acquisitions, starting from Tetley by Tata Tea for $450 million in 2000 to steelmaker Corus by Tata Steel in 2007 and the landmark Jaguar Land Rover in 2008 for $2.3 billion by Tata Motors.

ALSO READ | Vodafone confirms Idea merger talks, could create Indias biggest telecom firmInvestors in telecom stocks, who had turned wary after Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltds relentless onslaught, lapped up the news of possible consolidation in the sector. The market capitalization of Vodafone India, Idea Cellular and Bharti Airtel Ltd cumulatively rose by $4 billion on Monday. Shares of Idea Cellular and Bharti Airtel are now 4-5% higher compared to levels before Reliance Jios launch. While its true that a merger can result in meaningful synergies, investors are perhaps being overly sanguine about the sectors prospects post-consolidation.An analyst at a domestic institutional brokerage firm points out, Competitive intensity doesnt merely depend on the number of companies fighting for share; it largely depends on the strategy of the most credible challenger in the fight for market share. In other words, Reliance Jio will still hold the key to the sectors competitive dynamics.In fact, if the Vodafone India-Idea Cellular combine materializes, it may well inspire more competitive moves by Reliance Jio. Klaus Uhlenbruck et al., researchers based in the US, say in a paper titled Rivals reactions to mergers and acquisitions: Under conditions where rivals have significant resources to respond to a competitors acquisition or when rivals consider an acquisition to be a threat to their market position, they respond with a heightened number of actions, perhaps with greater breadth and complexity. On that note, besides Reliance Jio, even Bharti Airtel has the capacity to use significant resources to respond to the new market structure. Vodafones idea for an escape route from its Indian tormentAnd they might well have an upper hand, as Vodafone India and Idea Cellular navigate the troubled waters of integrating two very large companies. Analysts at Bank of America Merrill Lynch said in a 24 January note to clients, The focus of a merged entity could shift toward integration, thus diverting management attention from market dynamics. We believe that both Vodafone and Idea are behind Airtel and Jio in their 4G rollout strategy and any resulting material delay in rollout would lead to some market share loss in the long run. See chart for a previous M&A (merger and acquisition) involving Vodafone that faced integration issues. While Ebitda margins have improved lately, the joint venture continues to report net losses.  Ebitda is short for earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization.Of course, all of this is not to say that a Vodafone India-Idea Cellular merger doesnt make sense. Reliance Jios enormous investment in the sectoraround $30 billion for an industry with revenues of $27 billionis driving down profits and cash flow of incumbents on the one hand, and forcing them to up investments on the other. As a result, for companies such as Idea Cellular, leverage will soon reach alarming proportions.A merger will result in a stronger balance sheet, and can potentially result in higher profit margins. As such, it will provide the merged company more firepower to take on Reliance Jio and Bharti Airtel. Having said this, it is too much to expect it to be a panacea. Since Vodafone India and Idea Cellular are both behind the curve in terms of investments and their broadband network rollouts, they have little time to lose. The success of the merger will depend largely on the structure the new company adopts. While an organization structure that allows nimble moves is an imperative, it remains to be seen if this is possible in a company that has two large investors with equal rights.",2017-01-31,ZL7jov9xOFIyVndDXEMN7K,The likely merger of Vodafone  and Idea may well inspire more competitive moves by Reliance Jio,07:44,A Vodafone and Idea merger is no panacea for the telecom sector
0.07,"Mumbai: Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL) is likely to report a gain in  quarterly profit as a strong performance in its refining business may help offset weaker petrochemical margins. 
				   
				Net profit, excluding those of its units, may increase to Rs7,842 crore on a revenue of Rs65,752.6 crore for the three months ended 31 December, according to a Bloomberg survey of 11 analysts. In the year-ago quarter, the company reported a profit of Rs7,218 crore on revenue of Rs56,567 crore. RIL will announce its third-quarter earnings on Monday. At 9.15am, RIL was trading at Rs1,091.40 on BSE, up 0.11% from previous close while Indias benchmark Sensex Index rose 0.01% to 27,238.35 points.We expect this to be the eighth consecutive sequential earnings increase. Strong refining should more than offset the likely weaker pet-chem segment (weaker margins, and likely impact of demonetization), Nomura Research said in a 5 January note to clients. Analysts expect RILs gross refining margin (GRM) to be between $10.5 per barrel and $11.5 per barrel. GRM is the realization from turning every barrel of crude oil into finished products. Reliances GRM is likely to improve by a more modest $0.7 per barrel to $10.8 per barrel in third quarter due to a five-week maintenance shutdown in one of its fluid catalytic cracking units and sharper improvement in gasoline and fuel oil cracks relative to middle distillate cracks, brokerage Jefferies India said in a 4 January note. During the quarter, benchmark Singapore complex margins increased by $1.5 per barrel sequentially to $6.7 per barrel. RILs petrochemical business is estimated to report a drop in EBIT on overall weaker margins, planned shutdown and impact of demonetization. EBIT stands for earnings before interest and taxes and is an indication of a companys profitability. Petchem will be impacted by demonetization and lower spreads. Consequently, we estimate EBITDA to dip 6% quarter-on-quarter, Edelweiss Securities said in a 6 January note. During the December quarter, RIL commissioned the first phase of its paraxylene capacity. Analysts expect RILs new refining and petchem projects to add to earnings from the second half of FY18-19. On the exploration and production front, RIL is likely to report a small loss. US shale will continue to remain loss-making. Crude oil prices are higher year-on-year but domestic gas prices are lower. KG D6 production is expected to be down 24% on a YoY (year-on-year) basis. US shale is consolidated with one quarter lag, Bank of America Merrill Lynch said in a report dated 9 January. Analysts expect the companys telecom business to be a drag on profitability. RIL launched its telecom operations commercially on 5 September. Post its second-quarter results announcement on 20 October, RIL said the company will be investing an additional Rs1 trillion in its telecom venture. RIL has so far invested Rs2 trillion in the venture. Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd  (RJio), which launched an inaugural free voice and data plan beginning 5 September, extended it beyond December till 31 March. Over the past one month, competitive intensity has picked up, as incumbent telecom companies have started to offer higher data for free for 4G subscribers and effectively brought down pricing. For RJio, while the number of subscribers it starts operations with is critical, we would also focus on the absolute level of ARPU (average revenue per user). If RJio is able to maintain average ARPUs above Rs300 per consumer, it would be a positive, said JP Morgan, in a report dated 6 January.",2017-01-16,ZMAnnFXetk2byitVjJjdEK,"Reliance Industries petrochemical business is estimated to report a drop in EBIT on overall weaker margins, planned shutdown and impact of demonetization",00:54,RIL Q3: Strong refining margins may offset petchem weakness

				On a quarterly basis, the net income rose by 2.8%.The companys revenue in Q3 FY17 stood at Rs 11,814 crorea jump of 14.2% on year-on-year basis and 2.6% rise on quarter-on-quarter basis, as against Rs10,341 crore in the same quarter of 2015-16.We continue our robust financial performance with a revenue growth of 3% QoQ and 13.8% YoY in constant currency terms. The richness in our offerings coupled with our Mode 1-2-3 growth strategy is helping us gain a higher share of our clients wallet reflected in the increasing revenue contribution from our Top 5, Top 10 and Top 20 customers. Our revenues from fixed price /managed services contracts increased from 61.3% to 63.2% this quarter further strengthening our success in outcome based business model, said C. Vijayakumar, president and chief executive officer, HCL Technologies Ltd.In other financial highlights, the company saw broad-based growth across verticals driven by public services at 24.1%, retail and consumer packaged goods at 22.7%, lifesciences & healthcare at 14.0%, manufacturing at 11.2%, telecommunications, media, publishing and entertainment at 9.7%, and financial services at 5.4% . HCL Tech translated its revenue guidance for the current fiscal to 10-12%% in US dollar terms based on December 31 , 2016, exchange rates, as against the earlier guidance at 12-14%. We expect our FY17 revenues to be in the middle of this range, according to the company. The acquisitions and IP-led partnerships announced after 30 September, 2016, are likely to additionally contribute 0.6% to 1.0% in revenues depending upon the date of consummation of the geometric deal.The company also  reported that nine transformational deals were signed this quarter, across service lines, industry verticals and geographies. Anshoo Nandwaani,  vice-president & principal analyst, Greyhound Research said, The appointment of C. Vijayakumar in the last quarter is proving to be a good move for HCL Tech. HCL is going through a change and he is bringing in fresh perspectives in the way their deals are being constructed.There are clear efforts to modernize existing traditional infrastructure contracts (the ones with lower margins) and increase the use of digital technologies.While the company has managed to come out in good stead this quarter, sustaining this growth momentum, particularly amidst the realms of uncertainty in key markets like the US and the UK, will require both back-breaking work and innovative approaches towards IP development, automation and local/remote delivery to ensure non-linear growth, Nandwaani added.The Noida-based company also reported broad-based growth across all revenue segments with the Americas and Europe growing by 15% and 10.56%, respectively, year-on-year.At present, across all Indian IT Services providers, the digital revenues for IT services broadly range between 10 to 15%. Although HCLs current digital revenues are smallish, compared to other Indian IT Services providers HCLs thrust on Internet of Things (IoT) is impressive and significant. Further, at a time when IoT is growing in a big way, having expertise in embedded systems is an added strength for HCL Tech, said Nandwaani.However, experts warn that with a growing protectionist sentiment globally, Indian IT service providers, including HCL Technologies, face a bumpy road ahead.",2017-01-24,aFi62sw4b6L1uzcAviRIoL,"HCL Technologies consolidated net profit rises 7.8% to Rs2,070 crore for the third quarter ended 31 December 2016, as compared to Rs1,920 crore reported in the year-ago period",10:14,"HCL Q3 profit rises 7.8% to Rs2,070 crore"
0.21,"Earnings of refiners for the September quarter are likely to decline compared to the June quarter. Indian refining firms had benefited from substantial inventory gains in the June quarter, but that advantage will not be available for the September quarter, as there may not be a major inventory impact considering oil prices have not moved dramatically.
				   
				Whats more, refining margins have inched up only a bit. Benchmark Singapore gross refining margin (GRM) last quarter came in at $5.1 a barrel against $5 a barrel in the June quarter. In short, even though refining margins have risen a bit, lack of substantial inventory gains will mean that reported GRMs of Indian refining firms are likely to be sequentially lower.State-run refining and marketing companiesBharat Petroleum Corp. Ltd, Hindustan Petroleum Corp. Ltd and Indian Oil Corp. Ltd are no exception to that trend. On an overall basis, subdued refining performance will more than offset the benefit of robust market margins (calculated diesel retail margins up 32% QoQ) and healthy marketing volumes, wrote Edelweiss Securities Ltd analysts in their September quarter preview. Five brokerage firms previews studied by Mint show  that Ebitda of all three companies is expected to fall against the June quarter. Ebitda is earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization. But investors are sitting on good gains so far this year. In general, improving profitability, robust product demand and lower crude oil price environment have helped sentiment for these stocks.On the other hand, earnings of Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL) are expected to be reasonably resilient, Arya Sen and Ranjeet Jaiswal of Jefferies India Pvt. Ltd wrote in a report on 10 October. The brokerage firm estimates RILs stand-alone net profit to increase by 11% year-on-year and only 4% quarter-on-quarter decline, helped by strong refinery throughput and higher petrochemical earnings. Its GRM is expected to be close to $10 a barrel compared to $11.5 a barrel in the June quarter. Updates on its expansion projects and telecom business will be crucial for the stock. The RIL stock has gone up about 8% from its recent low on 2 September following the announcement of the forthcoming commercial launch of services by its telecom unit, at its annual general meeting.Meanwhile, the story continues to be grim for oil producersOil and Natural Gas Corp.

What you have just done is leveraging mobile, next-generation security, Internet of Things (IoT), cognitive computing, natural interfaces and analytics technologies to perform a simple but critical management intervention which ensured the smooth running of your business. Welcome to your new world, Ms CEO. A tsunami of new technologies has hit the business ecosystem. The first ripples were felt in the middle of the last decade and were evidenced by the likes of Salesforce.com and that upstart called Amazon Web Services, Inc. What a curious idea it was for an e-commerce company to expose, and rent out, its underlying infrastructure to third parties! IDC predicts a third of all industry leaders will be replaced by 2020. Thats how profound the disruption is. On the consumer side, the waves intensified towards the end of the decade as social media took centre stage and e-commerce boomed in every single major economy in the world. As I write this, Facebook has nearly 1.8 billion users and Alibaba has sold $18 billion worth of products in a single day. Consumer services companies, vividly exemplifying the sharing economy, have become household brands: today, more millennials possibly identify with Uber and Airbnb than they do with venerable corporations such as Johnson & Johnson, and GE. The force of the sharing economy is reshaping vast tracts of the consumer ecosystem, effecting the closure of retail giants such as Circuit City and Woolworths, and acquisitions such as that of Starwood Hotels by Marriott.The waves are swamping those without the lifeboat of digital capabilities.The first intense wave of change came with technologies which created what IDC calls the third platform of computing. The four pillars of the third platform, namely social, mobile, analytics and cloud (SMAC), today aggregate to a market exceeding $0.5 trillion. According to IDC research, its still expected to grow in excess of 13% in 2016, taking more than 35% of overall technology spending. It accounts for 110% of the industrys growth: traditional IT spending, while still two thirds of overall spend, is shrinking at greater than 5% a year. The third platform of computing is a profound shift in the computing paradigm. Users have moved from millions to billions, devices from tens to hundreds of millions and theres enough data generated on Planet Earth to fill up the memory of a stack of Apple iPads all the way to the moon and back. SMAC technologies have transformed IT fundamentally, and opened up entirely new opportunities for businesses. From smart products to analytics businesses and from real-time system enabled mobile field forces to digital supply chains, businesses across the spectrum have embraced these in different ways to drive economic value. The maturing of the third platform of computing has enabled entirely new technologies, and combinations, to develop and mature. IDC collectively calls them the innovation accelerators, as our research identifies their potential to drive not just technology and process but also complete business disruption. Of these technologies, the following five are likely to take centre stage in India in 2017. Watch out for them.Next gen securityIf youre like me and have a continuous wrestling match with your store of forgotten capital letter-alphanumericchange-them-every-two-weeks passwords, then I can give you some comfort. The era of the complicated password will soon pass. Next generation security systems are integrating biometrics (fingerprint, voice, iris recognition) with behavioural analytics (usage location, onsite/on-app behaviour, transaction patterns) to help make bank accounts, health records, government databases and countless other stores of sensitive information ever more secure. Though not visible to most, the security of the networks our data whizzes around on, and of the data centres which power up the modern economy, is also undergoing radical modernization. For example, network security is not just about appliances detecting bad actors anymore: its moving to a managed services model where the network is monitored for bad actors, real-time responses become a reality and damage control processes kick in instantly in the event of a hack. From Apples fingerprint readers to behavioural security platforms being introduced by the likes of Intel Security and Cisco, the industry is racing to help us realize the possibilities these technologies unlock. Expect a new paradigm in security to make life easier, and more secure, for you in 2017 and beyond. Cognitive systemsThe notion of intelligent machines has fascinated man for decades. It has been the subject of Hollywood movies, science fiction books and doomsday theories. Well, theyve arrived but not in the way you thought. I must stress that intelligent machines of the current generation do not have native intelligence as humans do. They are getting smarter on the back of their ability to process vast quantities of data really fast, and identify patterns and trends to be used. Who knows what the next generation of machines brings, though?A common example is the May I help you? assistants, which have appeared on e-commerce websites. Increasingly, you are not interacting with a human but a piece of software if you do ask a question. It has been programmed with learning algorithms, and fed masses of product catalogue and user behaviour data to be able to help you. Intelligent machines are also parsing through all the published legal cases and court decisions in recorded history to help lawyers serve their clients better; and doing exactly the same with doctors trying to figure out what might be wrong with a sick patient. IBMs Watson platform is perhaps the best known in this space, but its not the only one. Google has a different approach with the TensorFlow and Google Cloud Machine Learning combination. The analytics platforms from the likes of SAS are evolving too, as are new-age data storage systems from NetApp, HP Enterprise and their peers. The year 2017 will see consumer services firms in different sectors adopting cognitive technologies more aggressively. Expect the likes of banks, e-commerce companies, telecom service providers and hospitals to deploy them faster than others. From a wider perspective, the full story will unfold in 2018-19. Internet of Things (IoT)The Internet today has enabled interactions and engagement in society in ways which were not imagined even a decade ago. Video calling through the phone at practically zero marginal cost, cloud computing which allows organizations to think at global scale without the need for massive technology investments and a plethora of consumer services at your doorstep are just three manifestations of the amazing power of the Internet.The next wave is now upon us: machines are now interacting with each other and triggering processes without human intervention. In the process, mountains of data are being generated daily, enabling machine learning and cognitive computing. This is IoT. The 2016 IDC IoT survey in India, which covered 470 companies, reveals a great enthusiasm for IoT already. Process manufacturing companies as well as logistics services and trucking firms are leading the way. The Industrial Internet is born. The year 2017 is likely to see the inflection point of IoT adoption in India. Billions of sensors will help monitor oil pipelines remotely, control home air-conditioning systems and track trucks and pallets as they move through our vast countryside. Its potential is staggering, its promise mouth-watering. It can generate crores of rupees worth of efficiencies and productivity gains in the corporate sector; for consumers, it could mean being able to switch on your air conditioner before you reach home; or your coffee machine grinding the beans when the sensors in your bedroom note that youve up.  3D printingAt a recent conference, Anand Mahindra, chairman of the Mahindra Group, shared that they had put a 3D printer in a school as part of corporate social responsibility and R&D initiatives. The group was keen to see what innovation the children might come up with if they are given the right tools. The results are awaited but early signs are promising. The term 3D printing, in some ways, is a misnomer. They are actually capital goods equipment which operate visually like printers do. In the future, this technology is likely to radically remake manufacturing. Supply chains will be disrupted and the manufacturing process for many products will be democratized, with the possibility of garage-based production and retail store production already being realized. Nikes Fly Knit shoes are made in-shop after your foot is scanned and the images sent to the 3D printer. Skin grafts have been synthesized in labs; auto parts are being 3D printed. In 2017, we will see the gradual influx of these machines into manufacturing firms, research labs and the possible odd hospital. It will take some time and price cuts before 3D printers go mainstream. But it holds much promise and would be especially useful for far-flung areas of the nation. Natural user interfacesWhat I wouldnt give to not have to get up for the remote control, and simply change the channel on the television with a swipe of my hand, or through a conveniently placed gadget that would recognize my voice and change the channel! Thats Natural User Interface (NUI) for you and its here to stay. But really, while that TV remote is still important, a lot of what we experience is now being redefined by new forms of cognitive controls. The shift from text to graphics was a major leap, courtesy of Xerox Corpo ration, and popularised by Apple with their hallmark Macintosh OS in 1984. More recently, weve witnessed a revolution of sorts in the UI space: touch (smartphones), voice (Siri) and even gesture (Microsoft Kinect, Nintendo Wii).Today consumers want amplified, immersive and authentic experiences from what they consume; NUI enables just that. The human-machine interface is fast changing our experiences, thus heralding an era of multi-touch surfaces, powerful and lightweight mobile devices and now the emerging market of wearable technology. We are entering a fascinating world sans constraints physical and virtual.On the enterprise side, firms today are increasing the connect with their ecosystem of customers, employees, suppliers and partners, moving away from mere CX (customer experience) to authentic experiences. At IDC, were seeing this extensively in media and gaming; it is a matter of time before NUI permeates retail, healthcare, fashion and automobile verticals. It is my considered view that when the neural capabilities of touch, voice and gesture and the capable hardware thats available to process these inputs (at consumer prices to boot) are coupled with the large scale APIs to leverage these NUI opportunities, a new age of platforms which can redesign and revolutionize your experience will dawn. 2017 shall be a year when the increasing clamour for experience by consumers and the omni-experience transformation needs of enterprises shall see a scaling up of investments towards this aim. As this technology transformation evolves, so too will its impact on consumer experience and the digital business ecosystem.In sum, 2017 will see the next technological revolution reshaping Indian society, business and the government landscape. Recent events have already triggered the digitalization of the payments ecosystem at warp speed. The five technologies described above, individually and in combination, will herald the dawn of the next technological age.Jaideep Mehta is managing director, IDC India and South Asia.Five trends that can change the tech world by 2021Internet-of-things (IoT) software and solutions: IoT will be driving new levels of customer insight and engagement for some by 2021, but technology diversity and the need for organizational changes will still stymie or delay many firms.

0.5,"A revolution is brewing in the financial ecosystem that will extend the benefits of formal financial services to the masses. Global trends suggest that the banking and financial services sector are undergoing the change that the telecom sector witnessed a few years ago. A number of OTT (over-the-top) players came up with innovative solutions to provide a comprehensive communication experience. They leveraged the infrastructure created by telecom service providers and provided value-added services to consumers. Similar innovation is happening in payments and other financial services.
				   
				Traditionally, the banking system has had a stringent regulatory environment. This is beginning to change as regulators take cognizance of the innovation in the area. Companies providing value-added services over and above bank accounts for customers are getting good traction. These companies are coming up with constantly improving technology, data analytics and lean processes to provide high-quality services at an economical cost. Financial services can be divided broadly into two segments. The first category consists of frequently used services like payments, cash in, cash out, etc. These services will witness innovation in the area of customer experience. For example, payment being made through a QR (quick response) code-based solution enhances the experience of making a payment and has the potential of reducing a consumers reliance on cash. The second category consists of long-haul services like lending, insurance and cash management. This category will witness innovation that can extend the reach of these services to the masses. A company giving a personal loan based on utility-bill payment history or extending a working capital loan to a merchant based on its digital transaction history comes in this category. Companies are banking on their ability to provide such services to a hitherto untouched market. In India, the pace of this change is even more rapid due to the favourable combination of a government policy environment, a progressive banking regulator and the emergence of innovative fintech companies. The percolation of financial services to every citizen will happen the way it did with telecom services. The pace will only accelerate. Aadhaar is going to play an important role in this change. Innovation and regulation balance out each other and grow together. Innovation solves restrictions and regulation sets boundaries to safeguard consumers. When both innovation and the regulatory environment move in sync, the service delivery goes to the next level. The emergence of wallets, payment banks and small finance banks is the result of such synchronous movement of innovation and regulation.A large segment of the population will enjoy the benefits of formal financial services for the first time. The first step in this direction has already been taken with Jan Dhan accounts. Digital payments through various instruments like wallets, UPI (unified payment interface), cards, etc, are growing consistently. The last few months have demonstrated that consumers are willing to become digitally savvy if the right solutions are provided. A critical mass of consumers and merchants is getting comfortable with digital payments and apprehensions have reduced significantly in a short span. This is leading to a network effect and unprecedented growth in the digital ecosystem.Digital payments are leading to access to credit through formal channels for consumers and merchants who were unable to get this benefit till now. There is similar innovation in the areas of insurance and wealth management, where the focus is on increasing penetration of these services. For, services like wealth management have remained limited to a select segment. Technology companies are developing ways to provide such services to consumers irrespective of the quantum of their wealth. This is being made possible through technology innovation that renders the incremental cost of acquiring and servicing a customer negligible. Effectively, the reach of financial services and consumer experience is going to improve drastically in the country.Vijay Shekhar Sharma is the founder of PaytmThis is part of a series of articles in Mints 10th anniversary special issue that look at India 10 years from now.

0.25,"Reliance Industries Ltds (RILs) March quarter results were better than estimates, but only just. Its stand-alone Ebitda (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization) last quarter stood at Rs.10,727 crore, or about 3% higher than consensus estimates. According to a Bloomberg poll of analysts, Ebitda was estimated at Rs.10,394 crore.
				   
				In fact, some brokerage firms such as Kotak Institutional Equities had estimated Ebitda of over Rs.10,700 crore, on the back of strong margins in the petrochemicals segment. As it turns out, margins in the petrochemicals business were strong at 14%, far higher than 10.6% for the March quarter last year. Petrochemicals Ebit (earnings before interest and tax) margins were higher due to strong product deltas (rate of change in prices compared with the change in unit costs) and low absolute product prices. Petrochemicals Ebit increased 29% due to strength in polymer deltas, robust polymer demand and higher volumes in the polyester chain.Besides, RILs gross refining margin (GRM) at $10.8 a barrel was marginally higher than many analysts estimates. For instance, Morgan Stanley Research and BNP Paribas Securities (Asia) Ltd were expecting GRM of $10.6 per barrel and $10.5 a barrel, respectively. While the companys GRM has declined on a sequential basis, this was expected, considering that benchmark Singapore GRM had also declined compared with the December quarter. Whats more, the company has managed to maintain its premium over Singapore GRMs at $3.5 a barrel, as in the December quarter. Strong gasoline and naphtha cracks, robust demand growth and favourable crude markets helped boost refining margins, the company said. Higher utilization rates also helped.On a consolidated basis, while RILs organized retail business has seen a smart 26% year-on-year Ebit growth, this was offset by a sharp drop in the oil and gas segment Ebit (97% year-on-year decline). The stand-alone oil and gas business reported losses at the Ebit level due to lower realization for liquids and a decline in production, while a drop in prices affected the companys US shale operations.As pointed out earlier, the results were largely on expected lines and dont do much to move the needle as far as the stocks valuations go. Currently, one RIL share trades at 11 times its estimated earnings for this fiscal year. In the near-term though, the fact that refining margin has declined may cloud sentiments for the stock. So far, quarter-to-date, Singapore GRM has averaged at $5.2 a barrel, according to an analyst, compared with $7.7 in the March quarter. Of course, it would help if petrochemical margins remain steady.However, over the medium term, the outlook for the stock may turn positive as investors start looking at higher earnings on account of RILs expansion plans. As Amit Shah of BNP Paribas writes in a recent report, the benefit of expansion of petchem capacities, pet-coke and refinery off-gas cracker projects would be visible from FY18 onwards.But on the other hand, the prospects of the telecom business remain an uncertainty. BNP, for instance, has not assigned any value to RILs telecom business in its sum-of-parts valuation.

0.81,"Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp. reported revenues of $3.19 billion for the September quarter, marginally higher than the Streets estimate of $3.16 billion. On a sequential basis, revenues grew by 3.3%, which again doesnt look impressive for the traditionally strong September quarter. After the June quarters impressive 6% sequential growth, investors are evidently feeling let down.
				   
				But these quibbles aside, Cognizants results reiterate the fact that the company has been miles ahead of the competition this year. On a year-on-year (y-o-y) basis, its revenues grew by 16.5%, after adjusting for incremental revenues from the TriZetto Corp. acquisition. In comparison, industry leader Tata Consultancy Services Ltd (TCS) grew revenues by just 5.8% y-o-y. Infosys Ltd grew revenues by 7.6% and Wipro Ltds growth stood at just 3.4%.Just a year ago, TCSs growth was higher by about 300 basis points, when it was growing at a healthy pace of almost 15%. But while its growth has slipped sharply in the past four quarters, Cognizant has done just the opposite. The latters growth rate is now almost 11 percentage points higher, an unusually high differential in an industry that is so competitive. One basis point is 0.01%.Also note that Cognizant has raised its revenue growth guidance for 2015 each quarter, for the past three quarters, while analysts have been cutting growth estimates for most Indian tech leaders. Cognizant has benefited from not having any material exposure to troubled sectors such as energy and telecom. But thats not the only reason for its outperformance. There has also been a shift in the nature of IT spending in the past year, and Cognizant, with its higher exposure to discretionary services such as consulting (58% of revenues last quarter), has gained. Analysts at Kotak Institutional Equities said in a recent note to clients, Companies with inherent strength in run-the-business services are struggling to sustain momentum, while those with greater exposure to discretionary spending are gaining. Last quarter, the so-called run-the-business part of Cognizants portfolio grew by 1.5% sequentially, while growth in segments that depend on discretionary spending stood three times higher at 4.6%.As pointed out earlier in this column, Cognizant appears to have made disproportionate gains in the trend towards increasing spend on digital services. According to analysts, the companys early investments in this segment, including acquisitions it has made in the space, coupled with its consulting expertise, has helped it gain a higher share of this relatively new revenue stream.Its not that others havent had any success. TCS said after its September quarter results that revenues from digital services grew by 10% sequentially last quarter. Be that as it may, overall revenue growth numbers suggest that Cognizant has gained considerable market share this year, at the expense of large India-based IT companies. Last quarter, its incremental revenues of $426 million (on a y-o-y basis) were nearly double that of TCSs ($227 million), and higher than the cumulative incremental revenues of TCS and Infosys.This clear divergence is also reflected in the way these stocks have moved in the past yearCognizants shares have risen by over 35%, while those of TCS have fallen by 3%.",2015-11-04,beBSWzL5LdrIGeZM5tmu3H,"Cognizants results reiterate the fact that the company has been miles ahead of competition this year

0.2,"The inordinate delay in Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltds commercial launch is giving incumbents time in preparing for the coming onslaught. They first incentivized data consumption by cutting rates only for non-peak hours with so-called night plans. This week, Bharti Airtel Ltd and Idea Cellular Ltd increased data benefits on some of their pre-paid data recharge packs. Vodafone India Ltd hasnt bothered to respond yet. 
				   
				These arent signs of an industry desperately adjusting to the reality of a new large entrant; instead, the moves by incumbents suggest a carefully calibrated strategy that is aimed at ultimately blunting the price advantage of Reliance Jio. Consider the latest changes in pricing. Most headlines screamed Bharti, Idea cut data tariffs by 67%; but this is far from the truth. To start with, these companies havent cut tariffs by 67%; they have increased data benefits by 67%. And that too, only in some packs. Its important to note that the majority of data subscribers use plans ranging from 500MB to 1.5GB, with the flagship plan being the 1GB plan. The latest changes in tariffs havent touched this plan at all. In other words, incumbents arent yet ready to sacrifice revenues and margins with their flagship plans. Idea Cellular has inched towards making its data services more affordable in this segmentits 2GB plan now comes at the cost of the earlier 1.5GB plan. But clearly, theres no hurry to cut prices meaningfully in the most popular plans and drive volume growth. Also Read: Reliance Jio to go for Rs15,000 crore rights issue

This column has pointed out earlier that growth in data volumes has dropped sharply in recent quarters. For the top three telcos, incremental data volumes fell to 14,680 terabytes in the March quarter, compared with an average of 31,230 terabytes in the preceding four quarters. In this backdrop, its imperative that incumbents cut tariffs meaningfully to attract new customers and drive consumption. But it now looks like these significant changes in pricing will happen only after Reliance Jio launches. Evidently, incumbents dont want to play all their cards upfront.For now, they are teasing subscribers to increase data consumption by reducing the price of larger packs (exceeding 2GB). Considering that these companies are running under-utilised networks, these incentives dont entail additional costs. As such, revenues and margins are pretty much protected.But what this effective reduction in prices for larger packs does is that it further blunts the price advantage that Reliance Jio can offer when it eventually launches operations. Of course, theres no limit to how low Reliance Jio can go with prices to win market share. Even so, with the every successive calibration in data tariffs, incumbents have managed to reduce the extent to which Reliance Jio can disrupt the market.",2016-07-21,beknhdWUSzBNA8rY1yyXGJ,"Moves of Incumbents suggest a carefully calibrated strategy that is aimed at ultimately blunting the price advantage of Reliance Jio

0.35,"New Delhi: India Post Payments Bank (IPPB) launched on Monday by the Union finance minister Arun Jaitley is the second payments bank to commence its operation in the country after Airtel Payments Bank (APB), which was launched on January 12.
				   
				IPPB has been set up as a 100% Indian government-owned public limited company under the department of posts with the aim to open around 650 new branches in postal district headquarters. Currently, the department of posts has an existing network of around 1,55,000 post offices. The new branches will be co-located with the existing post offices. On Monday, it launched services on a pilot basis in Raipur and Ranchi.APB, on the other hand, is a joint venture between phone services provider Bharti Airtel Ltd and Kotak Mahindra Bank Ltd. The payments bank went live with a network of 250,000 banking points. In the pilot phase, the bank added over 1 million customers, according to a statement by the company. As mandated by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), the new model of banking focuses on providing basic financial services such as all kinds of payments; including social security payments, utility bill payments, remittance services, current and saving accounts up to a balance of Rs1 lakh, distribution of insurance, mutual funds, pension products and acting as business correspondent to other banks for credit products especially in rural areas and among the underserved segments of the society.However, there are distinct differences in the business models of both the payments bank. Mint compares the charges levied and interest rates offered by both the payments banks for rendering different services, including deposits and withdrawals.APB charges Rs5 to Rs25 for cash withdrawals less than Rs4,000 and 0.65% of the withdrawal amount which is equal to or greater than Rs4,000. IPPB does not charge anything for cash withdrawals from its branches and ATMs. However, it charges Rs15-35 for rendering doorstep banking (cash based) for both deposits and withdrawals up to Rs10, 000.The remittance charges levied by both the banks also differ. APB lists charges for transactions made through internet banking, through the app and USSD (Unstructured Supplementary Service Data) or *99# whereas IPPB also recognizes transactions through NEFT (National Electronic Funds Transfer), IMPS (Immediate Payment Service), AEPS (Aadhaar enabled payments system) and UPI (Unified Payments Interface).Only transactions up to Rs10, 000 is permitted through AEPS which is free. According to IPPB, banking charges at branch and doorstep for each NEFT based transaction ranges from Rs2.5-5 and Rs5 is charged for every transaction via IMPS.APB charges 0.5% of the amount transferred within its payments bank whereas 1% of the amount transferred is charged for transfer of funds from APB to other bank accounts through banking points.Customers of IPPB can withdraw amount up to Rs10,000 from an ATM in a single transaction and up to Rs25,000 per day. APB, on the other hand, has set Rs10 as the minimum cash withdrawal amount, there is no clarity on the upper limit to cash withdrawals.APB offers an high interest rate of 7.25% p.a. on deposits on savings accounts which is higher than the interest rate offered by traditional banks on fixed deposits.IPPBs interest rates have been fixed as 4.5% if the quarterly average balance is up to Rs25,000, 5% if it is between Rs25,000 and Rs50,000, and 5.5% if above Rs50,000.",2017-01-31,bvQa9dbOiZxQA6DBXNazoJ,A comparison of the charges levied and interest rates offered by India Post Payments Bank and Airtel Payments Bank for rendering different services,10:02,How does India Post Payments Bank stack up against Airtel Payments Bank

For perspective: advertising revenue, accounting for 56% of the total revenue, grew 29% compared with the past year. Ad revenue is expected to grow at 22.2% yoy (year-on-year) on a base of 15% yoy, Edelweiss Securities Ltd had said in its March quarter preview. A combination of premium content/properties during the quarter and overall viewership share increases helped the companys ad revenue growth beat expectations. The launch of Hindi general entertainment channel &tv did help advertising growth in FY16, says Mihir Modi, chief finance and strategy officer at Zee Entertainment.
				   
				On the other hand, subscription revenue, accounting for 39% of total revenue, increased at a relatively slower pace of 16.4%. Zee Entertainment derived its remaining revenue from other sales and services, the share of which dropped to about 5% compared with 12.4% in past years quarter. Overall revenue increased by about 14% to Rs.1,532 crore. Still, a decline in advertising and publicity expenses, and other expenses boosted operating profit performance.Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (Ebitda) increased as much as 53% year-on-year to Rs.414 crore.  Kotak Institutional Equities and Edelweiss Securities were expecting an Ebitda of Rs.372.7 crore and Rs.366.8 crore, respectively. Nevertheless, a higher tax outgo and rising depreciation costs together with a decline in other income meant net profit growth was much slower at 13% to Rs.260 crore.What next? What will really be worth watching is whether ad revenue growth performance is sustainable in fiscal year 2017. That should influence the stock, which has outperformed the benchmark Sensex in the past one year. Zee Entertainment expects industry advertising revenue to grow by 15-16% this year, a rate similar to last year. While it is true that the likes of Patanjali are adding to advertising momentum from FMCG (fast moving consumer goods) sector, some others in the FMCG space have slowed down; so, we expect stable performance from FMCG sector this year, says Modi. Also, its worth noting that advertising momentum from e-commerce firms is likely to soften, which would be compensated by better performance from auto and telecom sectors, he adds.Nevertheless, valuations seem to be capturing much of the optimism.

0.72,"Bengaluru: Flipkart chief financial officer Sanjay Baweja resigned this month, barely two years after he joined the online marketplace. Baweja, 56, is a veteran CFO, having held senior roles at Tata Communications Ltd, Emaar MGF and Bharti Airtel Ltd. He was hired to set up badly needed processes and systems, cut losses and prepare Flipkart for an eventual IPO. In an interview, Baweja spoke about why he left Flipkart ahead of plan, his achievements and dismissed allegations of fraud against him. Edited excerpts:
Why leave now?In the past two years, weve been able to expand the market in a big way. Weve been able to bring a lot of new customers into the fold, bringing more cities into play, bringing more pin codes into play. Thats happened because weve been focused on innovation; weve launched new stuff like product exchange, no-cost EMI. Weve built a very strong leadership team, especially in finance. From the time Ive come till now, the processes weve put in place, the standards of governanceits been a remarkable journey. We have the audit on a quarterly basis; the accounting closes on day 4-5 (of a given month); were on our way to SOX compliance (requirement under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act in the US). So, all of this allowed me to think that now that the company is in strong hands, I can move on to something fresh, something else I wanted to do.Where are you going after Flipkart?Im not at liberty to disclose that as of now.Much of the senior management that oversaw Flipkarts disastrous performance in the year ended March 2016 have been removed or have left. Does your exit have anything to do with this?No, my exit is about what I wanted rather than the other way round.How well prepared is Flipkart for an IPO? Any visibility on when an IPO will happen?Now that I have left Flipkart I cant talk about the timing. But as far as preparedness is concerned, we have transitioned. We are on our SOX compliance road map; we are meeting international standards. Like I said, we are doing quarterly audits, we close our books on a monthly basis on day 5 (of the next month). So, from the structure perspective, which Im used to delivering, were well on our way to being prepared. Now, the preparedness also has to come from a business perspective. Thats where the company will still take some time before it goes on the IPO journey.An anonymous Twitter handle has accused you of fraud and said that your exit was because of this alleged fraud. According to the Twitter handle Unicon Baba, Flipkart, at your behest, paid Tata Communications 30% more than it was paying its previous data centre supplier. Comment?Ive read it and its an absolute load of crap. We have robust processes. When we do an RFP (request for proposal) we invite people to bid for it. In this case, they (Tata Communications) were the only ones who could have delivered. When Chennai went down (during last years floods), our data centre was up and running. We went for the servers that were technically the most superior and lowest cost. I dont know where this 30% is coming from. Theres no inquiry. Nothing of this kind has come up.In the past two years, some senior leaders from established companies  who came to Indian Internet firms havent fit in and have had bitter experiences. Do you regret joining Flipkart?Not at all. Ive enjoyed every bit of the last two years. I enjoyed putting in the frameworks, the processes, the feeling of growing the company. When I was at TCL (Tata Communications Ltd), I had a great time. And then I took the call to come here. So, you take calls at some points in your career. I think Flipkart will go places and I will benefit eventually.ALSO READ | Flipkart CFO Sanjay Baweja resigns, replacement unclear",2016-10-27,cg7uvQRScEay19U9nF8X7O,"Outgoing CFO Sanjay Baweja on why he left Flipkart ahead of plan, his achievements and allegations of fraud against him",04:00,Flipkart is in strong hands now: Outgoing CFO Sanjay Baweja
0.25,"The announcement of the imminent commercial launch of services by its telecom unitReliance Jio Infocomm Ltdat its annual general meeting has augured well for the Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL) stock. Its share price has risen 7.5% from its recent low on 2 September. But its worth remembering that the stock has been an underperformer compared to the benchmark Sensex so far this year.
				   
				If you thought September quarter results would change sentiments dramatically, you are likely be disappointed. Stand-alone revenues have declined year-on-year but better operating profit margin, strong other income growth, and decline in finance and depreciation costs have helped the company report 20% growth in its pre-tax earnings. But that wont impress investors. Heres why: stand-alone Ebitda for September quarter came in at Rs10,555 crore. A poll of Bloomberg analysts was expecting the companys Ebitda at Rs10,569 crore. Thats pretty much in line. Ebitda is earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization.Unlike the June quarter when RILs gross refining margin (GRM) had surprised the Street positively, this quarter was fairly lukewarm. To be fair, GRM of $10.1 a barrel is not bad at all. The companys premium over Singapore GRM has dropped to $5 a barrel from as much as $6.5 a barrel. But investors are unlikely to punish the stock for that. For one, the companys GRM margin is slightly better than some brokerage firms estimates. Motilal Oswal Securities Ltd was expecting a GRM of $10 a barrel while analysts from Jefferies India Pvt. Ltd had forecasted a GRM between $9.5-10 a barrel.What really came as a big surprise this quarter is the performance of the petrochemicals business. According to the company, consolidated petrochemicals Ebit margin expanded to a 14-quarter high of 15.2% for the September quarter as product deltas held up well despite lower prices. Delta is the rate of change in prices compared with the change in unit costs. Strong volume growth also helped. Stand-alone petrochemicals Ebit increased to 16.3%, higher sequentially as well as on a year-on-year basis.As usual, the oil and gas business was a laggard, with Ebit declining as much as 83% year-on-year, adversely impacted by lower upstream production in domestic blocks along with lower prices. Sure, RILs organized retail business has done well but the segment is too small to make a big difference to overall numbers.On a consolidated basis, the companys debt service coverage ratio has declined to 0.88 from 2.79 in the June quarter. Is that a worry? According to independent analyst S.P. Tulsian, the decline in debt service coverage ratio should hardly be a concern for a company with RILs cash flows. Other analysts say the fall in the debt service ratio below 1 is just for one quarter and should not be extrapolated.What of the stock? Currently, RIL trades at 12.4 times estimated earnings for this fiscal year. Valuations arent exactly cheap considering that the refining environment is still sluggish. So far this quarter, benchmark Singapore GRM has averaged only marginally higher at $5.3 a barrel, says an analyst. RILs net debt has increased by about Rs10,000 crore sequentially to Rs1.06 trillion. Investors should watch out for that measure in the days to come.

0.58,"This weeks acrimonious separation between the chairman of Tata Group and its majority owners may now be heading for a divorce. Ratan Tata, who returned to head the conglomerate after ousting Cyrus Pallonji Mistry, is looking for a partner to buy the ex-chairmans stake, Bloomberg News reported on Thursday.
				   
				Should Mistry agree to sell, how much can he hope to get for his familys 18.4% of Tata Sons Ltd?Bear in mind that following his dismissal, Mistry raised some very serious allegations about both the holding company and several of its biggest publicly traded units. In hitting back at the board that fired him, Mistry said the groups net worth of $26 billion could be impaired by as much as $18 billionshrinking to just $8 billionshould writedowns be needed at businesses like Tata Steel Ltds European operations; Tata Motors Ltds passenger car business (ex-Jaguar Land Rover, the jewel in the empires crown); Indian Hotels Co.s overseas Taj properties; one of Tata Power Ltd.s plants; and a floundering wireless telecom venture with NTT Docomo Inc.As a seller, Mistry is unlikely to behave anything like a spurned chairman trying to score debating points. To maximize value, he might say he overestimated the risk of Armageddon. He might even admit the possibility that Ratan Tatas return to a conglomerate he chaired for two decades will reinvigorate the operating companies. Maybe Tata cant repeat a near sevenfold increase in book value over the period 2004-2012, but if global steel demand stabilizes, theres a fair chance the groups assets could reach a book value of $28 billion after a year. In the base-case scenario, the coffee-to-cars-to-software conglomerate wont be any worse off, and its assets would be worth in 2017 what they are today: $26 billion.Now suppose that status quo has a likelihood of 50%, while the probability of a massive writedown is 20%, and that of an improvement is 30%. That gives a one-year-forward book value of $23 billion. Considering that General Electric Co. trades at three times its estimated book value for next year, and companies in the more diversified Tata Group sell at 4.8 times, Mistry could perhaps ask for a halfway-house multiple of 3.75 times, valuing his 18.4% stake at a little under $16 billion.Only a patient investor who cares more about growth than current income would be willing to write that check. After all, the dividend received from operating companies yielded just 1.6% on Tata Sons investment last year, according to the Economic Times. An investor who paid a multiple of 3.75 to relieve Mistry of his stake would earn a divided yield of 0.4%.As for Mistry himself, at $16 billion, he would walk away with an annualized 4.5% return on the $200 million loan the Tata family took from outsiders 91 years ago. Include past dividends, and he might even have matched or beaten the 9% annual return from the US stock market since 1928. Thats hardly a divorce to feel unhappy about.

-0.01,"Bengaluru: Tata Group chairman Cyrus Mistry has a new worry in the growing pile of troubles afflicting Indias largest conglomerate. How to revive growth at Tata Consultancy Services Ltd (TCS), which accounts for 16% of the groups $103.5 billion revenue?
				   
				The troubles at Tata Motors Ltd and Tata Steel Ltd are well-documented. Despite TCS reporting a 3.7% sequential dollar revenue growth in the April-June period, the company is likely to report weak numbers in the second quarter, results of which will be declared on 13 October.Worryingly for investors, TCS now risks growing at a slower clip this year than last year, when its revenue expanded 7.1%, the slowest annual growth at TCS since 2009, when Natarajan Chandrasekaran took charge as its chief executive. TCS is expected to report an at-best 1.6% sequential dollar growth in the second quarter, according to brokerage BNP Paribas. This, on the back of 3.7% growth in the first quarter, translates into TCS doing $8.79 billion business in the first six months of the current financial year. TCS now needs more than $8.92 billion in revenue in second half of the year if it intends to grow at 7.1% this year. Simply put, TCS will need to record a better show in the October-March period this year than in the second half of last year. This certainly is a tall task as technology outsourcing firms report soft growth in the second half of the financial year.Undoubtedly, Chandrasekaran faces a tough task given the size of TCS.At the heart of TCSs slow growth is its inability to build a stronger consulting practice and reluctance to buy small firms for technologies like design consulting and automation platform providers. These tiny buyouts not just improve the current solution deliveries but also bring in growth. May be now, Mistry could nudge Chandrasekaran to start buying.With this as a backdrop, Mint puts the spotlight on five things to watch in TCSs second quarter earnings on 13 October:1. Revenue growthBrokerage BNP Paribas expects TCSs dollar revenue to rise 1.6% to $4.43 billion in the July-September period on a sequential basis. This is a big worry as this will mean that TCS needs to put forward its best foot forward in the remaining six months of the year if it wants to save itself from the humiliation of recording an even slower growth than last year. Management commentary on demand levels from its customers in Europe, after Britain voted to leave the EU, will be crucial.2. Pressure on profitability poses a double whammySince January this year, TCSs operating margins have been under pressure. TCSs 26.1% Ebit (earnings before interest and tax) margin at the end of March quarter was 54 basis points less than margins at the end of October-December period last year. The companys margins further contracted to 25.1% at the end of March quarter, which the management claimed to be largely on account of annual wage hikes. Now, as commoditized deals come under further pricing pressure, and TCS continues to spend money in reskilling its workforce and building digital technologies, traditional levers like going slow on hiring, will not be enough to offset the gradual decline in profitability. Analysts say that TCS is unlikely to end the current financial year with its stated guidance of 26-28%.3. What really is the problem among TCSs BFSI clients in the US?On 7 September, TCS in a mid-quarter update, said that some holding back of discretionary spending particularly in the BFSI (banking, financial services and insurance clients) vertical in the United States had led to sequential loss of momentum at the company. Is this just an one-off development or does this suggest a structural malaise? We know all IT vendors are seeing less business from big banks as these banks are spending less in application development work. Homegrown technology vendors are further seeing erosion in current revenue from the embrace of automation platforms, which is cannibalizing the existing model of billing clients on human hours. 4. Rain check of weak sectors and geographiesTCS does not expect growth to rebound in Japan. The company claims to have arrested any loss of business from its UK-based insurance platform Diligenta. Growth from telecoms segment continue to be wobbly. Together, an underperformance from the three units eroded about 2% growth from the companys 11.9% growth on constant currency basis in 2015-16. TCS needs to report some growth on a consistent basis if it has to better last years growth.5. Is higher net erosion of existing business biting into TCSs growth?During the July-September period last year, TCS claimed its order book was the strongest ever, with about 30% more than the company ever managed in any quarter. The company, however, does not disclose its order book size. Outsourcing deals are long-term contracts, and IT vendors can generate only about 3-4% of revenue from new orders in the first year, according to JPMorgan Chases George. Agreed, IT firms lose about 3-5% of current business every year, which in TCSs case, translates into a loss of about $500-825 million a year. This clearly suggest that TCS is losing more business from existing clients because even some business generated from its record order book has not offset the annual loss of business, thereby resulting in a sluggish y-o-y growth.",2016-10-12,hesaBaeP0eIEHrwSnqJO5K,TC is likely to report weak numbers in the second quarter and risks growing at a slower clip this year than last year,01:16,TCS Q2 earnings: Five things to watch for today

				The impending entry of a new fourth-generation operator would anyway mean a trip to the slaughterhouse for a few of the dozen existing players, some of whom are already making a run for the coop door. But thats a known risk. Its the threat of having to cede market share to billionaire Mukesh Ambanis Reliance Jio faster than imagined thats causing nervousness.That latter possibility has been raised by the Telecom Regulatory Authority of Indias (Trai) consultation paper on scrapping the compensation one wireless service receives for calls routed to it by another.That proposal to do away with the calling-party-pays system, the incumbents allege, smacks of bias. It would give a pricing advantage to a new network like Jio, which would be more likely to originate calls than terminate them. Meanwhile, Jio has complained that existing operators are sabotaging its ongoing beta trials by not offering adequate interconnection, leading to call drops.Incumbents have denied the allegation, and accused Ambani of running a service in the garb of testing. The dispute is fast turning into just the kind of melee the government, looking to hold its biggest-ever auction of spectrum a little more than a month from now, can ill afford.Also Read: Reliance Jio vs the rest: Trai, PMO dragged into the fightTo the extent the fracas is the harbinger of a bruising price war, its also bad news for shareholders of Bharti Airtel and Idea Cellular, which together with Vodafone control more than three-fifths of the market. The quest to expand data usage on their networks ahead of Jios long-delayed entry has already caused prices to head south:While data usage is indeed picking up, capital expenditure is accelerating. Ideas net debt is almost 5.7 times annual earnings before interest and taxes (Ebit); its 3.3 times Ebit for Bharti. With Reliance boasting to the regulator that its $20 billion investment in Jio is already more than any of its competitors, incumbents have little breathing room.When Kumar Mangalam Birla, Idea Cellulars controlling shareholder, sought to streamline his fiber-to-finance empire, minority shareholders balked at the prospect of being asked to fund his money-guzzling telecom venture. Ambani, on the other hand, has been lucky. His petroleum-refining business is minting cash, so creditors are giving him the chips to spin the roulette wheel and grab those 100 million Reliance Jio subscribers he craves.The stakes are high, and so are anxiety levels. With the regulator adding to the uncertainty about future market share, investors can expect more volatility. Idea Cellulars shares jumped as much as 7.9% on Tuesday before the company said media speculation about a sale to Vodafone is untrue and preposterous.The fluttering has begun. Tempers are flying and soon feathers will, too.

0.41,"The telecom industry continued to report average growth rates in the June quarter.
				   
				Voice revenues grew 3.8% and 4.6% year-on-year, respectively, for Bharti Airtel Ltd and Idea Cellular Ltd, and declined by 0.9% for Vodafone India Ltd.But worse still, growth in data revenue decelerated further. As the chart alongside shows, growth in data revenue fell to 35% and 27%, respectively, for Bharti and Idea, from as high as 70-80% just a year ago.In fact, in the June quarter, Idea and Vodafone slowed investments on their networks considerably, which is perhaps an indication that the data opportunity is not as big as was earlier thought.Idea added close to 6,500 3G + 4G sites (in Q1), compared with 17,000 in the previous quarter. Vodafones site additions also slowed to 6,000 3G + 4G sites as compared with 15,000 in Q4. Ideas and Vodafones lower rollout numbers are largely a reflection of the relatively limited spectrum portfolio, especially in 4G. However, it might also be an indication of their view on the market, where both companies have been relatively conservative, compared with Bharti, analysts at Kotak Institutional Equities wrote in a note to clients.Ideas voice volumes and revenue grew at a sedate pace as the company attempted to curb promotions. Since the move has backfired, it can be expected to be flexible with pricing to drive growth from Q2 onwards.In any case, industry dynamics have changed considerably since Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd launched operations in September. While data tariffs were anyway expected to be under pressure, Jio has also targeted the voice segment by offering unlimited voice calls at fairly low tariffs.The full impact of the Jio launch on average realizations and the growth metrics of incumbents will be visible only next year; but, its likely that some impact of additional promotions may be visible this year itself, especially in the December quarter.",2016-10-09,iVwWBc2fFY7BUcqAzKzMXP,"Growth in data revenue fell to 35% and 27%, respectively, for Bharti and Idea, from as high as 70-80% just a year ago",23:12,Telecom: slowing data growth a worry for industry

His regular ENT (ear, nose and throat) specialist had gone abroad for a medical conference and he didnt know of any other in his neighbourhood. He surfed the web for help and discovered, to his momentary relief, that he could fix an appointment online with a specialist at one of the hospitals not far from where he lived.
				   
				Hospitals, especially in India, have for long cut a sorry figure in terms of their digital savvy and use of information technology (IT) to be on par with their counterparts in sectors such as banking and telecom.According to Tirupathi Karthik, CEO of Napier Healthcare, a Singapore-based provider of software solutions to the healthcare industry, As compared to a global average of 22.5% of income spent on IT by healthcare providers, or even 6-15% being invested in IT in other sectors within India, anecdotal data from multiple sources indicate that healthcare providers in India rarely spend more than 0.5% of their annual revenue on information technology.  But things have been changing for some time, albeit at a pace slower than many would want. Leading the change are large hospital chains such as Apollo Hospitals Enterprise Ltd, Max Healthcare Institute Ltd and Fortis Healthcare Ltd.Prodded on by the need to take control of their sprawling operationswhich span dozens of hospitals in multiple citieson the one hand, and the rising expectations of tech-empowered consumers on the other, these modern hospitals are setting the template for healthcare in India.High time they did so. If you looked at the hospitals in India around 10 years back, they were very basic in terms of tech infrastructure. Besides, independent doctors got what they pretty much wanted. This led to lack of control with the management and poor visibility into the entire treatment and costs hospitals had to bear, says Varun Gera, founder and chief executive of HealthAssure Pvt. Ltd, a primary  healthcare aggregator that has partnered with almost 2,300 clinics, including diagnostic labs and hospital OPDs (out-patient departments). He says that somewhere along the line hospitals had to work as hospitals and it could no longer be the case of doctors having their own way of doing things. While part of this doctors-management clash had to do with egos, a more significant role was played by ITthe lack of it in the early days and increasing enablement as time went on. It is the clinical protocols, organisation-wide processes and use of IT tools through which hospitals, particularly those with a corporate road map to grow fast, could gain better control, get visibility into how treatment is given, and embrace more standardization for better healthcare outcomes across their chain of facilities.Once processes and IT tools began to be adopted, hospitals moved on from using basic networking and hospital information systems (HIS) to looking at electronic medical records (EMRs) and other advanced deployments for improving efficiency as well as patient care.According to research firm Gartner Inc., Indian healthcare providers are set to spend $1.2 billion on IT products and services in 2016, including telecom services.  Among the key areas in which hospitals are increasingly focusing their IT efforts are online doctor appointments, data capture of patients visiting the hospitals and applying analytics tools to get insights into their operations.One of the large hospital chains investing big time in IT is Apollo. One of the things we have done is enabled online appointment for doctors. Earlier, less than 10% of our patients came by appointment. Now at Apollo almost 50% of patients are coming by appointment, says Sangita Reddy, joint managing director, Apollo Hospitals.That is a huge change in terms of avoiding the chaos resulting from a lot of patients just landing up at its hospitals all over India. It also allows Apollo to focus on the more important task of clinical care rather than manage hordes of patients shuffling from one department to the other on its premises.More significant change is afoot through the use of data analytics for both clinical and non-clinical insights. We are collecting about 55% of all our patients clinical data electronically, which is enabling us to create a digital warehouse. This digital warehouse, in turn, is enabling us to do data mining and use this data in different ways, says Reddy.These efforts are helping Apollo in workflow prediction, staffing, communication, etc., and helping the organization turn into a data-driven enterprise.One of the key areas in which analytics is being applied at Apollo, according to Reddy, is the use of predictive analytics for clinical purposes. We have pioneered the concept of personalized health check-ups in India: instead of a common check-up, it is customized based on analytics of data of almost 1 million patients that have visited our hospitals over the years, she says. The decision tree for providing healthcare is being evolved based on scenario building through matching a particular medicine with a particular disease or condition that previous patients had encountered. The result is quicker treatment with improved outcomes.The analytics tool enhances the effectiveness of the medication that doctors choose, says Reddy.On the question of the acceptance of such tools by the medical fraternity, she says, We use these predictive analytics tools in a recommendatory manner, so its not forced on the doctorsand we have found a very high degree of acceptance. Currently being used in its large hospitals, Apollo will soon extend its use to other hospitals as well.There is a lot of scope for improvement in the way hospitals in India operate and use IT to manage operations and deliver healthcare in a seamless manner taking into account the intricacies involved in settling health insurance claims. According to Gera, The whole focus now is on getting the data out and efficiency of operations. The way hospitals operate currently is much fractured, as there are multiple complexities involved in their operations.And while technology cannot do everything for hospitals, the right tools and processes can make a big difference to the quality and speed of healthcare delivery in India.Among the tools for improving or aiding clinical outcomes, International Business Machines Corp.s Watson cognitive computing solutions for healthcare are being considered by many hospitals in India. One of the first to implement it is Manipal Hospital Enterprises Pvt. Ltd. According to IBM, Watson for Oncology is now in use by oncologists at six locations in the Manipal Hospitals network to provide information and insights to physicians to help them identify personalised, evidence-based cancer care options across India.If the past decade signified the modernisation of hospitals in terms of physical infrastructure, medical equipment and the like, the next one is likely to be defined by integration of multiple IT tools, advanced analytics solutions, health monitoring devices and Internet of Thingsunder which medical devices, computer systems, smartphones and diagnostic equipment will share data with each other in real time for individualised, improved healthcare.",2016-11-04,iX1AMyGsjOevaUwtoZVn4N,"Hospitals have for long cut a sorry figure in terms of digital savvy and the use of information technology.

0.54,"Bangalore/Mumbai: Amid the carnage on Wall Street in 2008, as Bank of America Corp. was trying to forge its rushed merger with Merrill Lynch & Co., Natarajan Chandrasekaran boarded a plane for New York to try to reassure the two financial behemoths that an Indian IT company could make the systems of their strikingly different cultures work together.
				   
				Chandrasekaran, known as Chandra, was then chief operating officer of Asias largest IT services exporter, Tata Consultancy Services Ltd (TCS). Over the following weeks he fended off global rivals who smelled an opportunity to muscle in, and set about integrating the banks systems and assuaging the new managements anxieties about outsourcing to a foreign supplier. TCS kept the business and grew it substantially.Last week, Chandra, now chief executive officer of TCS, was chosen for an even more fraught diplomatic task: to resurrect the image and fortunes of the Tata Group, Indias biggest conglomerate, which has been racked by losses at some of its biggest units, and by a boardroom battle that has threatened to turn the workings of the venerable corporation into a media soap-opera.Tata Sons, the group holding company, named Chandra, 53, as chairman, taking over on 21 February from interim chairman Ratan Tata. Tata, 79, had run the family business for more than two decades before handing over in 2012 to his hand-picked successor, Cyrus Mistry. In October, Tata Sons shocked Indias corporate community by firing Mistry, reinstalling Ratan Tata and promising to find a replacement by March. Chandra was a front runner for the job, a Tata employee almost all his working life, who grew TCS into the conglomerates most successful business, with about $16 billion in sales.Yet he is both an insider and an outsider. While he has been with the group since joining as an intern three decades ago, he is the first chairman who is not a Parsi, the shrinking ethnic group of Zoroastrians that boasts a disproportionately high number of Indias business elite. He is only the third person without the Tata name to get the job, and the first without a close family tie to the Tatas.IT CareerMoreover, his career and success has all been with TCS, virtually an island within the group that serves many of the worlds top corporations with a young, skilled, technical workforce. As head of Tata Sons, he will be responsible for a conglomerate that assembles buses in Zambia, serves prawn kalimiri to diners at its Bombay Brasserie in London, sells salt to Indian families at Rs18(27 cents) a kilo, and runs hundreds of other businesses across the world.He served both TCS and the customer commendably during the BofA-ML merger. Now he has the chance to build a positive organization by bonding together various companies and their half-a-million plus employees, said S. Ramadorai, the previous CEO of TCS. He is non-confrontational and, at the same time, does not foolishly ignore problems.Chandras appointment came after TCS announced it had made the equivalent of $1 billion in quarterly profit for the first time. Tatas star unit accounts for over half of the groups market value.A five-man panel unanimously chose Chandra from a list of more than a dozen candidates. He stood out both within the group and outside, said former bureaucrat Vijay Singh, a non-executive director on the board of Tata Sons, which ratified the selection. A Tata Sons statement said Chandra would uphold the groups values and adhere to its high standard of practicesthings the board previously accused Mistry of failing to do.We are at an inflection point, said Chandra in a statement after his appointment. I am aware that this role comes with huge responsibilities. It will be my endeavor to help progress the group with the ethos, ethics and values that the Tata group has been built on. Chandra declined an interview request for this story.Steel lossesFacing him is a menu of corporate issues, including the money-losing UK operations of Tata Steel Ltd., the overhang from failed ambitions like Tata Motors Ltd.s cheap Nano car, debt-ridden Indian Hotels Co., and a $1.17 billion arbitration battle with telecom partner NTT Docomo Inc. Mistry has previously defended his time as chairman, when he tried to reduce debt built up during a series of global acquisitions by Ratan Tata. In an e-mail to directors after his dismissal, Mistry said the group may face Rs1.18 trillion in writedowns over time because of  legacy hotspots he inherited.Mistry, whose family owns an 18% stake in Tata Sons, filed a case with the National Company Law Tribunal seeking the appointment of an administrator to oversee the companys affairs, a forensic audit and a probe into the role of the trustees of Tata trusts, the majority shareholders of Tata Sons. Hes asked for Ratan Tata, head of the trusts, to be restrained from attending board meetings. A spokesman for Mistry said he would not comment as the matter is subject to the legal proceedings.Investors expect Chandra to act quickly to resolve governance issues, said Shriram Subramanian, founder and managing director at proxy advisory firm InGovern Research Services Pvt. Key to his success will be how he handles Ratan Tata, who has indicated that he may step down as chairman of the trusts this year. Tata instigated the Nano project, a troubled airline venture and many of the other expansions that are now draining the groups resources.Tata congratulated Chandra on Twitter, saying he was sure the new chairman would protect the groups values and ethics. A Tata Group spokesman declined to comment.Chandra is an optimist, he thinks big and will go after positive outcomes in the new job, said Krishnakumar N., executive chairman of rival Indian IT services company Mindtree Ltd.The son of a farmer in rural southern India, Chandra studied in a Tamil-language school rather than gaining the English-language education favored by the middle class.He joined TCS in 1987 after completing a masters in Computer Applications from Regional Engineering College, Trichy, Tamil Nadu. His leadership talent was spotted by Ramadorai in 1993 when Chandra was praised by customer International Business Machines Corp. He was put in charge of a major project for British Telecommunications Plc. When Ramadorai became TCSs CEO, he chose Chandra as his executive assistant.He loved meeting customers, and it was never a Hi-How-Are-You? kind of a meeting, Ramadorai said in a telephone interview. He put the client at the center of the universe, made every conversation count and nurtured clients like American Express.Young CEOChandra took over as chief executive of TCS in 2009 at the age of 46. Over the next seven years, he would triple the IT companys share price and revenue and more than double its headcount.As Chandras corporate universe expanded, so did his interests, according to colleagues. Hes fond of photography and classical music, but his real passion is running. He has run marathons in Boston, Chicago, Berlin, New York, Tokyo and other cities.Being a runner has greatly shaped my thinking as a leader, Chandra told Runners World in October 2015. You have to decide on the length of the engagement, develop endurance to handle setbacks and increase speed when the competition demands it. You have to perform with your heart and your mind.At TCS, Chandra backed new technologies from cloud to mobile and evangelized to global corporations about digital disruption, always with a reputation for building close relationships with clients. Som Mittal, former head of Hewlett-Packard Co.s India operations, worked with Chandra for years in the software-industry trade body Nasscom and said if he texted Chandra, hed get a call back within 20 minutes.Whether he was preparing for a marathon in London or stepping into a client meeting in New York, he unfailingly called back, no matter what timezone and which corner of the globe he was in, said Mittal. He was also an inveterate traveler who would fly to client meetings even for the smallest deals. He has this uncanny ability of making everyone think they are his dearest friends.Chandra drove projects at TCS that dispersed the chaotic crowds and touts that used to clog the entrances of Indias passport offices and its best-known hospital, the All India Institute of Medical Sciences in Delhi. He charted new territories for TCS in Latin America and Japan by hiring local talent.His new role comes with a different set of challenges. He will have to stabilize the group and plan a decade or two into the groups future, said Ramadorai. It is a rough road.Looming over him will be the presence of a family that has been royalty in Indias business world for more than a century, and the scion of that family, Ratan Tata.Chandra is not afraid to express opinion and can be extremely firm when he is convinced about something, said Mittal. He is no pushover. Bloomberg",2017-01-16,icSPfNFcGFeEX4LWRyqbnM,Natarajan Chandrasekaran  will take over as chairman of Tata Sons from interim chief Ratan Tata on 21 February ,12:30,N.

0.25,"Singapore: Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltds entry into the telecom space is set to change the composition of the Indian economy, and its impact will be felt across all sectors, and investors should look at companies that are set to benefit from this communications revolution, said Mark Mobius, executive chairman of Templeton Emerging Markets Group at Franklin Templeton Investments.
				   
				Mobius, who oversees the Templeton research team based in 18 global emerging markets offices, said he would give high marks for the performance of the Narendra Modi government so far. He cautioned that after  the passage of reforms, the focus would shift to implementation.We have got to see implementation of those reforms so that the economy can grow and accelerate and continue on the high growth rate. So, I would say India offers an opportunity and a pitfall, and we have to keep an eye out for it, he added in an interview.Edited excerpts: India has recently seen three big reforms over the past few monthsthe goods and services tax, a relaxation in foreign direct investment norms and the bankruptcy law being passed. As an investor, how do you view these steps? Are these the last of the big reforms from the Modi government?All those steps are very good and the tax one is excellent. Now, what has to be done is implementation, because implementation with each state is really the key going forward. So, we have to look and see how fast implementation can take place, because that will determine the success of this reform. But, we are very excited about these changes, and the impact, of course, will be far-reaching, and will really be very dramatic going forward. Thats really the key, because we must not overlook the fact that implementation is probably more difficult. Getting passed in Parliament is one thing, but getting each state to implement it, to reduce the bureaucracy, to make things more efficientthat is really the key to success.The perception among investors outside is that the Indian markets are expensive. We are very excited about the Indian market. If you look at global firms, youll notice that India rating has been increasing. We are definitely very focused on India. Growth rate is very high, and we believe that this will continue with the reforms that we have seen, and so we are quite excited about it.Which are the sectors in the Indian market that you are excited about?First one, of course, is techsoftware, in particular, is very good for us. Secondly, it is the consumer sector and, particularly with the tax reform, I believe that the consumer sector will really surge ahead. Also, the companies and industries that will benefit from the revolution in communications with RILs (Reliance Industries Ltds) entry into telecoms, they are going to make telecommunicationsdatacheaper for everyone in India. This will set off a revolution in innovation and, I believe, companies that can benefit from that will really be the ones that you would want to look at. A lot of that will be consumer-oriented.How do you see RILs entry into telecoms? Will it be a game changer?No question about it. It is going to be a game changer. By bringing down the cost of the telecoms, and by enabling people to utilize telecommunications in a bigger way, cheaper, faster and more efficient way, the entire composition of the economy will change. This goes for the financial sector, it goes for the consumer sector, even goes for the industrial sectorso, everybody will be impacted by this. Its true that the competition has been hurt temporarily with RILs entry, but I think they will step up to the plate and be ready to compete.Which sectors in the Indian market should one avoid at this time?I think it is not avoidbut we have to be very cautious when it comes to the finance sector. As I mentioned, the changes that telecommunications and mobile will bring about to banking and transfer of moneythat is going to have a big impact on the financial sector. Those financial sector companies that are not able to keep up, they will be at a disadvantage. The other area is the companies that have benefited from the restrictionsstate restrictions, border control restrictions, tax restrictionsthese companies are going to be impacted soon, and we have to be very careful. Again, the companies which had state monopolies in certain areas because of the inability of competitors to come inthose companies are going to be impacted, too. So, we have to be careful about not picking these companies. Recently, in your blog, you had said while India is growing faster than China, the latter continues to be your top bet among emerging markets.Thats mainly because of the size of China. You have a lot of liquid and large companies in the China market, and access is easy through the Hong Kong market, which enables us to get in and out of Chinese companies. However, with these reforms in India, you will see the rating on India increase. If you see our global funds, you will see that happening already.Overall, how worried or optimistic are you on China?I am pretty optimistic about China. I know people are concerned about the debt, about the leverage, etc., but at the end of the day, it is a communist-controlled society, and they can control the heavy leverage that a lot of the companies have. As you know, the big banks and big companies there are all controlled by the government... Its a big economygrowth is continuing not only because of government spending, but also because of private sector growth. So, were optimistic. But in a country like that, just like in India, there will be winners and losers. We have to be very careful in stock selection.In a recent blog, you said that in 2016, emerging markets have outperformed developed markets in US dollar terms. What is your take on the mid-term and long-term performance of emerging markets equities when compared with the developed markets?In the long term, there is no question that emerging markets will outperform for the simple reason that economic growth in emerging markets will continue to be at least double that of the developed countries. So, as long as that is the case, we can expect emerging markets to outperform. If you look at history, there is a correlation between market performance and economic growth. So, thats an important point to keep in mind. The other thing is that there is a slew of frontier marketscountries that are just starting out in the market economy adventure and these companies and countries will be growing at a very fast pace because theyre starting from a low base. That also will boost emerging markets generally.How do you see the emerging markets being impacted by the gradual increase in US interest rates?Its very important to look at the history of interest rates and emerging markets performance. If you compare the US Feds funds rate against the emerging markets performance, there is no real correlation. For example, the period between 1988 and 1993, interest rates went down and the emerging markets went up. Everybody expects a correlation between interest rates and performance; but then, if you look at the period from 2003 to 2007, interest rates went up and the emerging markets boomed. From 2007-09, the correlation held because interest rates went down and the emerging markets went down. So, its different from what you would expect. I think people are putting too much weight on the interest rate, particularly the US Federal Reserve rate and what the markets will do. There is a good chance that if the US Fed raises the interest rate, then emerging markets could outperform. You just cannot say that when interest rates go up, the market goes down. It doesnt work that way. History shows thats not the case.How do you rate the performance of the Modi government so far? Do you think it has delivered on many of its promises in terms of reforms, in terms of ease of doing business?I think there was too much euphoria when they were elected, and we foresaw that they would have difficulty in the beginning. So, we didnt expect the tremendous surge of reforms because we knew the barriers that they were facing in Parliament and so forth. However, the fact that they have been able to pass the tax reform and that they have been able to make changes is very heartening to us. To us, it indicates that the Modi government has done a pretty good job. I would have like to see (former Reserve Bank of India governor) Raghuram Rajan to stay on in the central bank. That is probably one negative to the Modi government; but then, if his successor continues on the same policies in a quiet way, then it should be OK. I would say we would give them high marks for performance.In India, what do you feel are the challenges and risks going forward?Again, it is not just the degree to which reform takes place. We have got to see implementation of those reforms so that the economy can grow and accelerate and continue on the high growth rate. So, I would say India offers an opportunity and a pitfall, and we have to keep an eye out for it.How do you see the private equity space in South-East Asia?Its very good. It is a great opportunity here in South-East Asia because there are so many new enterprises that are getting started and, of course, the impact of China on South-East Asia, in most parts, is very positive. China is, of course, the main trading partner, and as China surges ahead, these countries will be pulled along with them.

0.06,"Mumbai: Shankar Sharma, vice-chairman and joint managing director of First Global Securities Pvt. Ltd, is known for his strong and contrarian views. He thinks that the demonetisation exercise will affect larger companies more than smaller ones. Edited excerpts from an interview:
What do you make of the unexpected set of events, Brexit, demonetization and Donald Trumps win, that impacted Indian markets?I would not say the events were unexpected. After the great financial crisis, extremist politics has become popular across the world, be it Modis win here or Trumps win in the US.I think by now, we should be used to weird things happening. I think 2008 was a watershed moment for the world, not only because of the financial crisis, but because of the impact it had on peoples mindset and psychology. It hit them hard that they lost their jobs, their savings dwindled and so on. They were then willing to gamble with their politics, or take a blind, under-analysed bet on anyone who promised them these basics. People have been hurt widely since 2008they are angry, bewildered why their perfect lives suddenly went badand smart politicians across the world have leveraged on this by showing easy cures and fantasy fixes. The extremist politics is just peoples answer of their outrage to why us? That is what also led to events that we saw in 2016.How do you see 2017 panning out for Indian markets?I am very negative on large cap (stocks) in India in light of the recent demonetization. I was tepid about them before. I am, however bullish on Indian small cap stocks and micro-cap stocks.Demonetization has been a big, big shock to companies earnings and economic growth. The near-term impact is significant. I do not hold out much hope for large caps in terms of their ability to recover quickly. Banks will be the hardest hit as there is no credit offtake and (there is) a slowdown in demand. It may even hit recovery of loans, and even add marginally to non-performing assets.Why are you bullish on small caps and micro-cap stocks?They dont necessarily have to bank on government or strong domestic economic growth per se. Small companies can find a niche area, a good product or they find demand from a specific industry. So, I find many of those attractive bets in small and micro space. Some of those companies have corrected, and valuations are pretty attractive.Where do Indian equities stand vs emerging market peers in 2017?Before demonetization, I was reasonably optimistic on India outperforming emerging markets or at least performing in line with them. India was going to stand a little behind commodity-producing markets, which had rallied on the back of a recovery in commodity prices. There was, however, a good monsoon after two bad years, and consumption was finally looking up. There was general optimism on earnings growth, which has been very tepid in the last few quarters.However, post demonetization, things have turned bad, at least for a few quarters. I think India is now going to lag other emerging markets in 2017.Whatever tepid growth rate we were seeing, that also is in question right now. Also, post a shock like that, while people say it will hurt the economic growth for one or two quarters, the point is nobody knows. Macroeconomics is not arithmetical. It is not like I give x input and y output is delivered. Sometimes, it may happen, sometimes it may not, and sometime a completely un-modelled thing may happen.It is very clear that the economic growth momentum is broken. How does it come back, how much you need to stimulate for it to come back and whether we have the firepower to stimulate that much, we do not know. So, suddenly from being reasonably okay position, we are in a situation where we need to invest hugely to repair the damage.If you are thirsty, you drink a glass of water. But if you are dehydrated, you need to be put on the drip. Now, the stimulus has to be disproportionate to the loss the economy is suffering. Does the government have that ammo?Do you think demonetisation was a wrong move by the government?That is not a call I can take. It is for the government to make these decisions.Do you think there are more negatives than positives from it?If you want to look at it from the lens of politics, I think it is a terrific move. If you look at it from the economic or financial lens, its a very muddled picture. For a government in power, the objective is to win elections at any cost. If this helps them achieve this, I think it is all okay, because ultimately like an asset management companys sole purpose of existence is to gather assets, the sole purpose of a political party is to win elections. Period. Performance etc. are all secondary.The goods and services tax is set to be implemented next year. How do you see things shaping up post its implementation?Even before demonetization, the general consensus has been that there will be a near-term impact of adjustment and understanding of GST on economic growth. There are various factors that come into play when a big change like this is introduced. So, even without demonetization, it would have had a significant near-term impact in terms. Now, post demonetization, we are looking at a double whammy to the economy in the immediate future after its implementation.What is your budget wishlist ?I am not a big budget analyst or a big budget watcher. In my view, Indian budgets are generally fairy tales and I dont believe in fairy tales. I dont waste my time analysing it. I think it is just a statement of intent. I dont listen to what they (government) say, I only watch what they do.Private investment demand has not revived for a long time. What is the missing piece that can help revive this?This government has decided as the Big Brother that I will do the all the spending in the economy because I know better than an individual consumer as to where to spend.So, if you see all the economic auctionsall money flows to the government that obviously gives them the power on how low the pricing for telecom etc. can gothe government has decided the economy belongs to them, and not the citizens; and they will decide how economic gains are spent, not the citizens.As we enter 2017, which sectors do you really like in Indian markets, and which sectors would you avoid?The one sector I will definitely avoid is banks. Banks have been over-owned in India. In such a situation, upside usually gets capped. After demonetization, private lenders will suffer as consumption hits a hurdle. Public sector banks that primarily lend to industries were, as it is, going through bad times. The economic slowdown is going to hurt even more than before.",2016-12-26,oxgZihdWTzj0Ns5iw0SCNN,Shankar Sharma of First Global Securities believes demonetisation will affect larger companies more than smaller ones,00:51,I think India is going to lag other emerging markets next year: Shankar Sharma
0.71,"Infosys Ltds December quarter results were in line with Street expectations, which isnt great news because expectations had been running low. Revenues fell 1.4% sequentially to $2.551 billion, largely due to the ramp-down of a large project with Royal Bank of Scotland Plc. (RBS) subsidiary Williams and Glyn.
				   
				While the trouble with the RBS project was already known, it turns out that revenues from some other large clients also fell meaningfully last quarter. Revenue from the top 10 clients fell as much as 9.1% sequentially. The RBS project is estimated to have accounted for about half of that decline, which means revenue from other large customers fell 4.5% sequentially.The company management played this down, saying this was due to the seasonal weakness that is typical of the December quarter. Customers take furloughs and have a lower number of working days at the end of a calendar year.But the companys guidance for the full year and the March quarter doesnt inspire much confidence either. According to analysts at Emkay Research, the annual guidance suggests revenue growth of 0.3-1.8% in the March quarter in constant currency terms, which is lower than the 1.9% sequential growth reported by the company in the corresponding period a year ago.ALSO READ | Infosys cuts full-year revenue guidance againThe company said certain pockets of headwinds and some client specific changes are responsible for the guidance, even though most of the verticals it operates in look set for a bounce-back. Analysts at Nomura Research said in a recent note to clients that improvement in demand for IT services could be lagged and likely to reflect only by 2QFY18. They added that the recovery is not uniform with the US banking and financial services (BFS) sector improving, and European BFS, telecom, retail and healthcare client financials showing soft trends, and that the policy uncertainty on immigration in US/regulation in BFSI (banking, financial services and insurance) could keep momentum slow at the start of the year.Infosys and Tata Consultancy Services Ltds December quarter results and related commentary provide little reason for any optimism. Its hardly suspiring stocks of both companies fell on Friday, with the latter falling by over 4% thanks to additional concerns about the change in its leadership.ALSO READ: TCS Q3 profit rises 8% to $1 billion, beats forecastsA silver lining in Infosyss results was a slight improvement in margins, despite headwinds such as lower employee utilisation due to furloughs and the ramp-down of the RBS contract.

0.73,"Just when you think Bharti Airtel Ltd already has all the mobile spectrum it needs, the company goes ahead and buys some more. Last Friday, it announced it will pay Rs.3,500 crore to buy spectrum in the 2300MHz band from Aircel Ltd in eight telecom circles. This is less than a month after it agreed to pay Videocon Telecommunications Ltd Rs.4,430 crore for spectrum in the 1800MHz band in six circles. The spectrum in both these bands is suited for fourth-generation (4G) telecom services.
				   
				Growth for telecom companies is already being driven largely by the data segment; in Bhartis case, voice revenue has declined on a year-on-year basis in the past three quarters. In this backdrop, it makes sense to have adequate spectrum to support efficient data services.Analysts at JM Financial Institutional Securities Ltd point out in a note to clients, With this deal, Bharti will have 490MHz of broadband (3G+4G) spectrum on aggregate basis across the 22 circles, versus 486MHz of all 4G spectrum owned by Jio. Bharti now has 4G-spectrum (i.e. 1800MHz or 2300MHz) in all 22 circles, and both 1800/2300 frequencies in 13 circles.Besides the wide coverage, spectrum trading has opened a new avenue for purchasing the hitherto scarce asset. In spectrum auctions, the only avenue available earlier, companies often ended up bidding up prices to extremely high levels. After adjusting Aircels spectrum valuation for its remaining validity of roughly 14.5 years, Bharti Airtel has ended up paying around 10% higher than the reserve price set by the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India.If Bharti had let the opportunity pass and waited for the auctions, it may have had to shell out a substantially higher amount. JM Financials analysts say, We now expect Bharti to focus primarily on filling up its 2100 (3G) and 1800 (4G) gaps in the next auction; reduced competition for 2300 augurs well for other 4G-contenders like Idea/Vodafone. Of course, the deal is a win-win for Aircel as well; this helps it reduce its debt by about one-fifth, according to news reports.While the deal augurs well for Bharti in the long run, investors must note that the benefits may not be visible anytime soon. As it is, the pace of data subscriber additions has slowed, calling to question the large investments on this segment. Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltds launch later this year could put a spoke in the wheel as well.Even so, these are early days of consolidation and, eventually, subscribers may veer towards telecom operators who provide the best service. If Bharti is able to put all of its spectrum to good use and provide quality voice and data connectivity, its investments can result in substantial returns.",2016-04-11,tLnDGcKIgpJu98oSreWSxL,"If Bharti Airtel had let the opportunity pass and waited for the auctions, it may have had to shell out a substantially higher amount

0.42,"Reliance Communications Ltd (RCom) said it has signed a binding agreement with Brookfield Infrastructure Group to sell its tower assets. 
				   
				It will receive an upfront payment of Rs11,000 crore, besides B class non-voting shares in the tower company.These shares will provide 49% future economic upside from the business, based on certain conditions, the company said in a statement.The long pending sale failed to cheer both stock market investors and credit rating agencies. RComs market capitalization has risen by around Rs200 crore since the deal was announced. This is no more than a drop in the ocean, considering that the companys market capitalization had fallen by around Rs13,000 crore so far this year. Investors seem to be ruling out any major upside from the 49% holding through non-voting shares. The value of the retained stake depends on the conditions set by Brookfield, which are currently unknown. According to an analyst with a domestic institutional brokerage, It is evident investors arent factoring in an upside from the retained stake; after all, RComs market value hasnt changed dramatically and still is only around Rs8,900 crore.As the things stand, i.e. assuming that the Rs11,000 crore valuation for a 51% stake is fair, RComs towers have been valued at around $74,000 each. This is understandably at a huge discount to Bharti Infratel Ltd, whose towers are valued at around $100,000. One of RComs large tenants, Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd, is reported to have contracted rentals that are considerably lower than market rates. As such, profitability and return ratios of RComs tower assets are likely to be lower than peers.Its also important to note that credit rating agency Moodys Investors Service has retained its cautious view on RComs debt. RComs B1 corporate family and senior secured ratings remain on review for downgrade despite signing a binding agreement with Brookfield Infrastructure in relation to the sale of RComs tower assets, Moodys said on Thursday. As the rating agency points out, there are still a number of imponderables. The wireless entity that will emerge after the proposed merger with Aircel is expected to be heavily indebted. Operationally, the wireless business is expected to be among the worst hit as big boys Jio and Bharti Airtel fight it out by lowering tariffs. It also remains to be seen whether the retained businessincluding undersea cableswill be able to service the debt that remains on the companys books.An RCom investors best bet is that the firms books are adequately spruced up to make it a suitable match for an acquirer such as Jio.

Scheduled for a 17 November, 2017 release, the estimated budget of the Ranveer Singh, Shahid Kapoor and Deepika Padukone-starrer is around Rs180 crore, making it one of Indias most expensive movie productions, said trade experts who declined to be named. About Rs150 crore has been set aside for production and the remaining for promotions, advertising and other expenses.
				   
				Media reports in the past two months suggested that the film would mark the unique collaboration of two major Bollywood corporate housesEros International that had backed the previous two films directed by Bhansali, Bajirao Mastani and Goliyon Ki Rasleela Ram-Leela, and Viacom with which he had co-produced Mary Kom and Gabbar Is Back. But Eros backed out of the deal in October, industry experts say, because of a financial crunch. Eros International Plc.s stock has fallen since August this year. Its shares, as of Friday on the New York Stock Exchange, reads last traded at $18.13 apiece, down from $19.23 apiece on 8 August . Bombay Stock Exchange listed Eros International Media Ltd stock witnessed a sharper fall in the same period, falling to Rs176.90 on Friday from Rs230 apiece on 8 August. Padmavati is the second film that Eros has let go of recently; it earlier backed out of Ajay Devgn-starrer Shivaay, which also had a budget of over Rs100 crore.

For one, it involves Bhansali, who is riding high on the Rs184 crore net box office collections of Bajirao Mastani. A director is always assured a budget equal to the recovery that his last film made. The challenge is to go beyond that and there is always about 10-20% risk for the studio involved, said Jayantilal Gada, chairman of film-producing and presenting company Pen India. Plus with him (Bhansali), its a case of take it or leave it. Look at any of his films and you can see the money spent on every scene, they are all meant to be big screen experiences.To be sure though, in absolute terms, Padmavati will have to equal the Rs500 crore plus gross collections of war epic Baahubali: The Beginning to recover the investment, said Atul Mohan, editor of trade magazine Complete Cinema, given obstacles like rising ticket prices and rampant piracy in the movie business.He is a very sensible director and you definitely need these larger-than-life films once in a while to provide variety for audiences. But the Indian box office is highly unpredictable and a big-budget film gone wrong can totally break a studio as the examples of Mohenjo Daro and Bombay Velvet show, Mohan said. Viacom shelled out about Rs40 crore for the satellite rights of Bhansalis Bajirao Mastani. The Rs150 crore production budget for Padmavati means that Viacom will spend about Rs75 crore from its own funds and the remaining will come as loans from banks. A mere Rs35 crore extra would give them rights to a Bhansali film that would, as most people agree, stand a class apart. Plus there are a variety of revenue streams available for Viacom to recover its investment in Padmavati.Earlier films were dependent on theatrical, music and satellite rights for earnings. Now there is such a huge revenue proposition in the form of digital apps, every mobile is a shop now, said Sanjay Bhandari, a financial adviser to the film industry.Viacom especially stands to benefit thanks to its video-on-demand service Voot, a joint venture with Reliance Industries Ltd, which in September launched its telecom operation. The studio remained unavailable for comment.Producers arent just looking at recovery on the table now, at least 30-40% of the recovery happens after the release.

0.5,"The next few years will be definitive for the evolution of Indias digital infrastructure and the role it can play in the countrys growth. There is significant unfinished businessIndia is ranked 91st among 139 countries on the Networked Readiness Index 2016, compiled by the World Economic Forum (WEF). Only 15 out of 100 households have access to the Internet, and mobile broadband remains for a privileged few, with only 5.5 subscriptions for every 100 people, according to the WEF. However, India has skipped a generation in telecom technologygoing from no connectivity to over 350 million mobile Internet usersin less than two decades. This needs to be factored in while planning the democratization of digital access in India. 
				   
				The impending growth of digital assets will present India with many unique opportunities to leapfrog its traditional deficit in physical infrastructure. It will help enhance the economic conditions in remote areas, spur new businesses by enabling access for a large number of small and medium enterprises (SMEs), creating a strong digital identity for the country. Above all, digital infrastructure growth can empower the government to embrace and enable innovation, provide resources to help increase agricultural productivity as well as enable improved healthcare access for rural areas, potentially reducing mortality levels. It can also bring financial services to the unbanked rural and underprivileged communities and help fulfil the countrys longstanding goal of education for all. Digital literacy in smaller towns and villages can create employment in sectors such as business process outsourcing (BPO), retail, IT, telecom and financial services. Digital India can also ensure citizens have ubiquitous access to government services. While mobile technology has begun to make a transformative impact, digital access in Internet dark areas, could have a larger socio-economic impact.                                                                                                                              *******While the story of the potential value that Indias digital infrastructure can add, has been told many times, developments in this sector have so far lagged expectations. The governments flagship projectthe National Optical Fibre Network (NOFN)is yet to fulfil its promise for rural India. In this scenario, we continue to trail the worlds major economies in telecom infrastructure maturity and penetration. Network investments by mobile operators are being held back, due to the poor economics driven by low tariffs and a high level of competition. This has hit carriers ability to upgrade consumer services, meet demand in highly populated urban areas and expand networks to provide coverage to rural areas. The next few years could see unprecedented changes in the quantity and quality of digital access. Few would argue against the need for a robust digital infrastructure in India. However, one must realize that the economic barriers to that are very high. The following factors will be key to achieving Indias digital infrastructure dream:Expanding spectrum assets: Few policy changes have a greater impact on infrastructure creation, than optimizing spectrum availability over time by releasing unlicensed spectrum, revising allocations and enabling free sharing and trading. Spectrum is a scarce resource. The ever-increasing projections of mobile traffic growth in India, make a compelling business case for allocating more spectrum for mobile usage. These allocations need to include licensed and unlicensed spectrum bands to accommodate both network coverage and capacity needs. While India has taken a few steps in the right direction such as the department of defence releasing spectrum in the 1,800-2,100 MHz bands, it still needs a better and more comprehensive spectrum policy. India lags behind many developed and emerging markets in per-capita availability of spectrum. Also, the cost of spectrum here is one of the highest in the world. The primary goal for policymakers should be to maximize the use of spectrum, rather than focusing on its short-term value. Also, the more harmonized the spectrum used by mobile operators, the more economically viable the overall solution to improving Internet access. This calls for effective synchronization of Indias spectrum planning, allocation, network design, financing and construction. Also needed is a national policy to enable access densification in areas with low-income but high-growth potential.Creating broadband infrastructure: Let us turn our attention to the resources required for the creation of broadband infrastructure. India currently ranks low in broadband penetration, even among developing countries. Internet access has grown, driven by a higher penetration of mobile handsets and wireless infrastructure in urban and tier I and tier II towns, but  broadband penetration in the larger part of the country is still dismal. Current estimates show that broadband only reaches approximately 600 corridors, largely in and around the top 50-100 Indian cities. On the other hand, the country aspires to create a Digital India with a broadband highway offering a 100-Mbps connectivity to 250,000 gram panchayats. The funds needed to create a national IP backbone and ensure last-mile connectivity have not been supported by a strong underlying business case. The creation of Digital Bharat calls for radical changes to regulatory frameworks, allowing the generation of viable business models for inclusive broadband growth. There is significant public funding involved in making NOFN come true, but private sector operators have so far seen little value in pursuing fiber deployment beyond the top cities. This calls for the creation of robust models of public-private partnership, driven by a combination of rights of way, release of spectrum and creation of a content ecosystem to spur revenue generation via digital infrastructure. Enhancing technology adoption: This is the other side of the story, where industry participants need to get their act together. Over the last few years, new and existing players have made significant investments in transforming the infrastructure for 3G/4G/LTE roll-outs. In a country with relatively low average revenue per user (ARPU), carriers will need to continue focusing on infrastructure build-outs to increase coverage and improve customer service quality. With a large part of the data consumption moving indoors, the industry needs to move towards small cell deployments. White-labelled small cell deployment makes great economic sense for all high-demand concentration centres. Further, developments in software-defined-networking (SDN) and network-function-virtualization (NFV), have the potential to redefine the economies of infrastructure deployment for operators. Virtualization needs to become business-as-usual. This will make infrastructure deployments simpler (commodity hardware with centralized software), more cost effective, agile, reliable (battle-proven commodity hardware) and flexible (digitally defined network topology and functions). These virtualized networks will be at the core of the telecom industrys digital transformation, redefining our infrastructure into a programmable platform for a variety of new services. As an example, business-to-business connectivity business models are already being completely disrupted with software-defined wide area networks.                                                                                                                             *******Ultimately, the economics will work when there is demand for services and development of new use cases. The creation of the content and services stack in remote locations, will be key to drive adoption. There are multiple areas where digital infrastructure can play a big role in creating opportunities. These include public and law enforcement records, health data including patient and insurance records and academic and employment records. Other areas include location services, digital identity including identifiers and demographics, communications and local content. Multiple stakeholders need to come together to create an effective ecosystem of content, services and governance that will increase usage, ultimately creating the business case for a robust public-private investment. But implementation of such initiatives is fraught with constraints related to consumer privacy, ownership of data, data security and protection. Digital India will become a reality only if we can create the data ecosystem required and find solutions to overcome these constraints.Over the next few years, we need to prevent market failures in digital infrastructure creationfailures that are borne out of unfavourable economics and lead to suboptimal development of digital infrastructure and issues in both quantity and quality of digital access. The scale of change required to make this happen is disruptive and unprecedented. For digital infrastructure to take root and flourish in India, all stakeholders will have unique roles to play. For individual business leaders, it will mean overcoming technical, economic and business model-related growth challenges in a transformative way. Ultimately, the combination of public-private funding, progressive government policies and freeing up of spectrum assets will determine whether India is able to fully address the digital divide. The initiative will also hinge upon faster adoption of new, cost-effective technologies by industry players and the creation of compelling business use cases.

Dish TV will own 55% and Videocon a 45% stake in the new company.There was a need for consolidation in the industry because of the competition and regulatory challenges. This transaction, that brings together two powerhouse brands of the cable & satellite industry in India, will provide us with a gateway to harness growth opportunities in an ultra competitive multi-player environment, Goel said.The transaction, still subject to regulatory approvals, is expected to create a leading cable and satellite distribution platform in India, the companies said in the statement.This merger will take the company to another level. The combined synergies will create value for all the stakeholders. Its a new opportunity, said Saurabh Dhoot, executive chairman at Videocon d2h.In July, the information & broadcasting ministry accepted recommendations of the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India, which had proposed increasing licence duration of DTH firms to 20 years from 10 years and cutting their annual fee to 8% of adjusted gross revenue (AGR), from 10% of gross revenue.We have been facing discrimination in the broadcast distribution space. These changes will sure come as a relief, said Goel of Dish TV.For the quarter ended September, Dish TV posted a net profit of Rs70.1 crore. It added 259,000 subscribers during the quarter, taking its net subscriber base to 15.1 million.Jehil Thakkar, head (media and entertainment) at consulting firm KPMG, said consolidation in the DTH industry was long expected.This may potentially spark a consolidation in the Indian DTH and cable distribution space.

				The dynastic business that built a reputation over more than a century for discretion, integrity and fair-dealing has sunk into a public spat of allegations and name-calling. Its directors trade barbs. Its share price is tumbling. And on Friday, executives were jostled in the street while security staff engaged in an unseemly brawl outside Bombay House, the groups revered headquarters.How did it come to this?The drama dissecting Tata Sons, Indias largest industrial group, revolves around Ratan Tata, scion of a family that built an empire so diverse that it writes financial software for Goldman Sachs Group Inc., sells pick-up trucks in Uganda and offers packaged salt to Indian families at Rs.18 a kilo.Two weeks ago, Ratan Tata threw the group into confusion and the public spotlight after the Tata Sons board sacked his successor as chairman, Cyrus Mistry, and wrested back control for the 78-year-old. Neither Tata nor any other board member or major investor has suggested that Mistry financially mismanaged the group. He remains head of many of the affiliate companies, such as Tata Motors and Tata Steel.Instead, Mistrys ouster was the result of growing discontent from Tata, who ran the company for two decades, at what he considered was an undermining of the Tata brand, according to people who have worked with both and asked not to be named because the matter is private.Egos have been bruised, said Harsh Goenka, chairman of RPG Group, another Mumbai-based conglomerate. He said the Tata name stands for humility, humaneness, benevolence, grace and boldness of vision, and it has been dented by the current conflict.Since Mistrys removal as group chairman, Tatas more than two dozen listed companies have lost in excess of $8 billion in market value. Ratan Tata didnt respond to a recent request for an interview.Brand TataTatas adherence to the idea of the brand being a byword for integrity has run throughout his career, according to interviews with more than a dozen people who have worked with him. Banks would routinely do business based on Tatas word, and once he committed to doing something, he would see it through no matter what, said a person with knowledge of some of his deals.When Tata Steel bid for Corus Plc in 2006, it arranged financing with three banks for around $5 billion to $6 billion, said the person, who asked not to be named because the negotiations were private. As the price rose in a bidding war for the European steelmaker, Tata officials found cheaper funding, but would have to pay a break fee with the original banks of about £80 million ($99 million). Some executives tried to negotiate a cheaper release, but when the matter was brought to the attention of Ratan Tata, he insisted the original contract be honoured, the person said.Tatas decision echoes the groups current spat with Japanese telecommunication partner NTT Docomo Inc., which is one of the key battlegrounds in the war of words between Tata and Mistry. Docomo is trying to enforce a London Court of International Arbitration decision ordering Tata Sons to pay $1.17 billion for failing to uphold a contract, signed during Ratan Tatas 21-year period at the helm.A Tata Sons spokesman declined to comment while Mistrys office referred to a 1 November statement on the companys partnership with NTT Docomo.Tata became frustrated at Mistrys seeming reluctance to pay, which reflected on the Tata name, according to people familiar with the case. In an email to the directors after his removal, Mistry said it was the board that has not covered itself with glory, by the way he was dismissed.Family codeBut the Tata family code, rigorously pursued by Ratan Tatas predecessor, the legendary industrialist, aviator and philanthropist J.R.D. Tata, extends far beyond just sticking to your word.J.R.D., whose portrait looked down from the boardroom wall in Bombay House as Mistry was being ousted, made Tata famous for refusing to pay bribes. He founded many of the businesses that are now key units, such as Tata Motors, and funnelled a large chunk of profits to social programs such as Asias first cancer hospital and the Tata Institute for Social Sciences.He handpicked Ratan, the great grandson via his adopted father of group founder Jamsetji Tata, to carry on that family legacy. Trained as an architect at Cornell University, Ratan began on the shop floor in 1962, stoking Tata Steels blast furnaces, before gaining experience in several positions in the group.In 1991, he took over the chairmanship and set about establishing his dominance over group companies, which had become rich and autonomous during J.R.D.s five-decade reign.In the 1990s the Tata Group was ruled by powerful satraps and he very dexterously distanced all of them from their powerful positions and gained total control, said Goenka, chairman of RPG. The one common factor that defines Ratan Tata then and now is that of an astute leader. He eased out Cyrus Mistry from the chairmanship that took India Inc. completely by surprise. If the past was about a loud war cry, the present is about stealth.During his first chairmanship, Tata expanded the company rapidly, often by acquisition, turning a predominately India business into a global group with $103 billion in salesahead of Gazprom and International Business Machines Corp. He also sowed the seeds for many of the groups current troubles, including the purchase of Corus, the venture with Docomo and the ill-fated Nano car project.Since about 2004, with the question of his succession looming, Tata gradually increased his control in the operations of the group, said a person who worked closely with both Mistry and Tata. He took major decisions with less board consultation than previously, the person said.Ratan Tata has always consulted senior executives in all his decisions, including the Corus acquisition, said a Tata official, who asked not to be identified citing company rules.New successorThe eventual choice for a successor was Mistry, the son of one of the biggest shareholders in Tata Sons, his own brother-in-law and a fellow member of the Parsi communitythe isolated followers of Zoroastrianism whose ancestors fled to India from Persia a millennium ago.With Mistry deposed, Tata is back at the helm promising to find a new successor before March. Next month he will be 79.I do not think Ratan Tata has any option other than to hold on to the position that he has taken back, whether he likes it or not, said Kavil Ramachandran, executive director of the Thomas Schmidheiny Centre for Family Enterprise at the Indian School of Business in Hyderabad. In the interest of every stakeholder, he has to take steps to get the situation back on track.While Ratan took the groups products to more than 100 countries, he retained the ethos of his predecessors, that in building a business you are also helping to build India.Nano InspirationThe Nano was inspired by seeing an Indian family riding on a motorbike in the rain. It epitomized Ratan Tatas qualitieshis vision and attention to detail, as well as his stubbornness and reluctance to terminate a key business thats losing money.Tata spent hours with the Nano development team, focusing on getting every detail right for the most anticipated auto release of 2008, said a person who worked on the project. Yet the car was marketed as cheap, a stigma that was reinforced by dealers who had little interest in pushing a low-margin vehicle.When Mistry led the introduction of Tata Motors latest modelthe unfortunately named Zica hatchback, rechristened Tiagohis main concern was how to ensure the car would be profitable, according to the person who worked with both Mistry and Tata, and asked not to be identified as hes not authorized to speak to the media. Mistry talked to staff about what he, and even his children, thought of the marketing campaign and what needed fixing, the employee said.Ratan Tatas vision for the group was a globally diversified and successful conglomerate with some distinctive values, said Rishikesha T. Krishnan, director and professor of strategic management at the Indian Institute of Management Indore. Cyrus Mistry did not dismantle that vision, but he appears to have been particularly concerned about the viability of different businesses.If something went wrong, Tata would tell you to your face and then take immediate steps to rectify the problem, said a senior Tata Sons executive who has known Ratan Tata for more than two decades. He described Tata as a humanist with a deep sense of compassion, who was keen on products that fostered social justice like the Nano, or Tata Salt.In 2012, after grooming Mistry for the top job for a year, Tata stepped down as group chairman, and moved from his relatively modest apartment to a white, three-story house he built on the seafront near the exclusive Colaba neighbourhood of Mumbai, with a private gym and rooftop infinity pool looking out over the Arabian Sea, according to local newspaper reports.Start-up InvestingHe threw his energies into working with entrepreneurs, investing nominal sums in more than three dozen startups ranging from artificial intelligence to online sales of womens lingerie.Those who met him spoke of his imposing presence, graciousness and attention to detail in how ideas would work.Mr Tata. listens intently, has a curiosity to learn and often gives a fresh perspective that hasnt been considered, said Vani Kola, head of venture capital fund Kalaari Capital. He notices the smallest things, he puts people at ease.At the same time, he continued to keep any eye on the Tata Group as head of the powerful family trusts that hold a majority stake in Tata Sons. According to several people who know Tata, he became increasingly frustrated by what was happening to the company that bore his name.On 24 October, before the board meeting in Bombay House, where stray dogs are allowed to roam the corridors, Mistry was told of the decision to remove him.Cyrus Mistry was handpicked by Ratan Tata, said Goenka. This time he will look for someone who understands the Tata culture and the Tata way of doing things, better. Bloomberg",2016-11-08,ylJCy9morUM9QsY5DRkqhN,"Tata group, the dynastic business that built a reputation over more than a century for discretion, integrity and fair-dealing has sunk into a public spat of allegations and name-calling",11:24,Ratan Tatas return as interim chairman seen taking toll on Brand Tata

0.29,"India is making efforts to set up one more container trans-shipment terminal, closer to the east-west trade lane, with the cabinet approving a facility at Enayam in Tamil Nadu. The success of the latest trans-shipment adventure will squarely rest on getting one of the global top three container shipping lines to become an anchor investor in what is essentially a liner-driven business.
				   
				For that to happen, India needs to revisit its qualification criteria for selecting potential terminal developers at its major portsthose owned by the central government.The evaluation criteria for potential bidders set by the government in 2009 ignores the role played by shipping lines in contributing to the performance of a container terminal let alone a container trans-shipment terminal.In computing the experience score of an applicant to consider it eligible for qualification, experience in core sectors such as power, telecom, ports, airports, railways, metro rail, industrial parks/estates, logistic parks, pipelines, irrigation, water supply, sewerage and real estate development are factored in. Experience in running a shipping line, which brings business to these trans-shipment hubs, is not included.This explains why none of the global container shipping lines are part of container terminals operating at major ports. Since they dont bring any value to the table for qualification purposes, port developers are loath to signing them up as partners.On their own, they dont qualify because shipping is not part of the core sectors drawn up for working out experience scores.Geneva-based Mediterranean Shipping Co. SA (MSC), the worlds second biggest container shipping line, did apply in partnership with Adani Ports and Special Economic Zone Ltd (APSEZ) in an auction for developing a container terminal project at Jawaharlal Nehru Port a couple of years ago. The APSEZ-MSC team was qualified to bid, but the experience score for that joint venture was counted on the basis of APSEZs credentials.This is not the situation at non-major ports or ports owned by the states but given to private firms for development and operations. For instance, APSEZ, which runs Indias biggest private port at Mundra in Gujarat, has two of the worlds top three container shipping companiesMSC and CMA-CGM SAas partners in two separate terminals.Unlike gateway terminals, trans-shipment facilities are dependent on big container lines, a fact that has been acknowledged globally.Trans-shipment hubs such as the ones located at Tanjung Pelepas in Malaysia and Colombo in Sri Lanka have shown that having a shipping line as anchor investor in the port (Maersk Line in the case of both Tanjung Pelepas and Colombo) is eventually the determinant of success. Making the liner invest in the port makes it a stakeholder in the ports success and, thus, incentivizes it to move existing traffic and establish a minimum scale of operation. The liners are also keen to operate from a port where they have investments since this will enable them to influence port planning decisions and port operations, take long-term bets while planning routes/vessel commissioning decisions and help improve overall cost economics and flexibility on pricing.About 25%, or some 2.8 million twenty foot equivalent units, or TEUs, the standard size of a cargo container, originating from or destined for India, is trans-shipped every year at overseas hubs, en-route to their final destination.Colombo, Singapore and Port Klang (Malysia) handle more than 80% of this cargo. Of this, Colombo alone handles around 1.2 million TEUs, which is a significant loss of revenue for Indias exporters, importers and ports; it builds inefficiencies in logistics and creates risk to the countrys competitiveness in export trade.The shipping ministry says there is a strong economic case for building a new trans-shipment hub in and around the same region to attract Indian and regional trans-shipment traffic from the current hubs. But is it justified?Enayam will be the third container trans-shipment terminal to be located a few kms apart from each other on Indias southern tip. Of this, Vallarpadam in Cochin port has been operational since 2011 without much success. None of the global top three container lines are an anchor investor in the facility, which is also facing multiple hurdles in its efforts to become a major hub as planned.Vizhinjam, also in Kerala, is being developed by APSEZ. There are indications one of the top three global container lines could make Vizhinjam its trans-shipment hub as the qualification rules applicable to major ports will not be relevant here as it is a port outside the control of the centre.APSEZs strong ties with two of the top three container lines at its Mundra port, where one of the container terminalsa joint venture between APSEZ and MSCis undertaking trans-shipment operations, would help make a similar partnership a reality at Vizhinjam. There are several more commercial advantages, including pricing flexibilities that flow from building a trans-shipment hub outside Indian government ownership. Vizhinjam has also secured the key environment clearance, which Enayam is yet to receive. Enayams success, to a great extent, will depend on its ability to convince a major shipping liner to become an anchor client and re-route its traffic from the competing ports, consultants TYPSA and Boston Consulting Group wrote in their techno-economic feasibility report on the Enayam project.Container shipping lines take a long-term view and consider several factors such as minimum deviation from the main trade route, and lower port charges when deciding their preferred trans-shipment port, given the costs of reconfiguring their existing route networks, according to TYPSA and BCG.But, given that Enayam is being developed as a major port like Vallarpadam in Cochin and the consequent applicability of shipping-unfriendly evaluation criteria, it calls for a change in rules.With Indias shipping ministry set to revise a so-called model concession agreement (MCA) for public-private-partnership (PPP) projects at major ports, the time is apt for reviewing the qualification rules.
